35623161	Acinetobacter baumannii: More ways to die.	Acinetobacter baumannii is an important nosocomial and opportunistic pathogen. It causes infections worldwide, especially in intensive care units. It is clinically significant owing to its ability to persist for long periods on surfaces, as well as its resistance to multiple antibiotics. This pathogen has been reported to defy the available therapeutic options to combat it. In this dire circumstance, the need for new approaches to treating A. baumannii infections is undeniable. In this minireview, we summarize three important treatment options for controlling A. baumannii pathogen, including the use of bacteriophage / bacteriophage cocktails, phage-antibiotic combinations and resistance-driven fitness losses. It is hoped that, as resources to treat its infection expand, A. baumannii can become less scary.	2022 Aug	Greater Kayode Oyejobi, Sunday Olabode Olaniyan, Nana-Aishat Yusuf, Deborah Adepeju Ojewande, Mobolaji Johnson Awopetu, Goodness Opeyemi Oyeniran, Fazal Mehmood Khan, Peter Alabi Dare, Maryam Kikelomo Adegbite-Badmus	Microbiol Res
35311522	Cefiderocol- Compared to Colistin-Based Regimens for the Treatment of Severe Infections Caused by Carbapenem-Resistant Acinetobacter baumannii.	Cefiderocol may represent a therapeutic option for carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB) infections, but clinical data are limited. This is an observational retrospective study conducted in the University Hospital of Pisa including consecutive patients with CRAB infections (January 2020 to August 2021). Patients were divided in two study groups according to the antibiotic treatment received: cefiderocol- and colistin-containing regimens. The primary outcome was the 30-day mortality. A Cox regression analysis was performed to identify factors independently associated with 30-day mortality. A propensity score analysis using inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) was also performed. A total of 124 patients were included: 47 (37.9%) received cefiderocol, while 77 (62.1%) colistin-containing regimens. Overall, 79 (63.7%) patients had a bloodstream infection (BSI), 35 (28.5%) a ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and 10 (8.1%) other infections. Thirty-day mortality was higher in patients receiving colistin- compared to those who received cefiderocol-containing regimens (55.8% versus 34%, <i>P</i> = 0.018). This difference was confirmed in patients with BSI, but not in those with VAP. On multivariable analysis, septic shock, SOFA score, and age were independently associated with 30-day mortality, while cefiderocol therapy was protective in an IPTW analysis (Hazard ratio 0.44, 95% confidence interval 0.22-0.66, <i>P</i> < 0.001). Nephrotoxicity was more common in the colistin group. Microbiological failure occurred in 17.4% of patients receiving cefiderocol <i>versus</i> 6.8% of those receiving colistin (<i>P</i> = 0.079). Among 8 cases in the cefiderocol group who experienced microbiological failure, 4 (50%) developed resistance to cefiderocol. Cefiderocol represents a promising therapeutic option in patients with severe CRAB infections. Randomized clinical trial in this specific patient population should confirm our findings.	2022 May	Marco Falcone, Giusy Tiseo, Alessandro Leonildi, Leonardo Della Sala, Alessandra Vecchione, Simona Barnini, Alessio Farcomeni, Francesco Menichetti	Antimicrob Agents Chemother
36200470	Acinetobacter baumannii: Pathogenesis, virulence factors, novel therapeutic options and mechanisms of resistance to antimicrobial agents with emphasis on tigecycline.	Acinetobacter baumannii is one of the most important nosocomial pathogens with the ability to cause infections such as meningitis, pneumonia, urinary tract, septicaemia and wound infections. A wide range of virulence factors are responsible for pathogenesis and high mortality of A. baumannii including outer membrane proteins, lipopolysaccharide, capsule, phospholipase, nutrient- acquisition systems, efflux pumps, protein secretion systems, quarom sensing and biofilm production. These virulence factors contribute in pathogen survival in stressful conditions and antimicrobial resistance.	2022 Nov	Razieh Dehbanipour, Zohreh Ghalavand	J Clin Pharm Ther
36173300	Acinetobacter baumannii and Cefiderocol, between Cidality and Adaptability.	Among the bacterial species included in the ESKAPE group, Acinetobacter baumannii is of great interest due to its intrinsic and acquired resistance to many antibiotics and its ability to infect different body regions. Cefiderocol (FDC) is a novel cephalosporin that is active against Gram-negative bacteria, with promising efficacy for A. baumannii infections, but some studies have reported therapeutic failures even in the presence of susceptible strains. This study aims to investigate the interactions between FDC and 10 A. baumannii strains with different susceptibilities to this drug. We confirmed diverse susceptibility profiles, with resistance values close to the EUCAST-proposed breakpoints. The minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC)/MIC ratios demonstrated bactericidal activity of the drug, with ratio values of ≤4 for all of the strains except ATCC 19606; however, bacterial regrowth was evident after exposure to FDC, as were changes in the shapes of colonies and bacterial cells. A switch to a nonsusceptible phenotype in the presence of high FDC concentrations was found in 1 strain as an adaptation mechanism implemented to overcome the cidal activity of this antibiotic, which was confirmed by the presence of heteroresistant, unstable subpopulations in 8/10 samples. Genomic analyses revealed the presence of mutations in penicillin-binding protein 3 (PBP3) and TonB3 that were shared by all of the strains regardless of their resistance phenotype. Because our isolates harbored β-lactamase genes, β-lactamase inhibitors showed the ability to restore the antimicrobial activity of FDC despite the different nonsusceptibility levels of the tested strains. These <i>in vitro</i> results support the concept of using combination therapy to eliminate drug-adapted subpopulations and regain full FDC activity in this difficult-to-treat species. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> This work demonstrates the underrated presence of Acinetobacter baumannii heteroresistant subpopulations after exposure of A. baumannii strains to FDC and its instability. Both A. baumannii and FDC are of great interest for the scientific community, as well as for clinicians; the former represents a major threat to public health due to its resistance to antibiotics, with related costs of prolonged hospitalization, and the latter is a novel, promising cephalosporin currently under the magnifying glass.	2022 Oct	Stefano Stracquadanio, Carmelo Bonomo, Andrea Marino, Dafne Bongiorno, Grete Francesca Privitera, Dalida Angela Bivona, Alessia Mirabile, Paolo Giuseppe Bonacci, Stefania Stefani	Microbiol Spectr
36087691	Genotypic and phenotypic comparison of clinical and environmental Acinetobacter baumannii strains.	The genotypic and phenotypic characteristics and antibiotic resistance (antibiogram) profiles of clinical (n = 13) and environmental (n = 7) Acinetobacter baumannii isolates were compared. Based on the Repetitive Extragenic Palindromic Sequence-based PCR (REP-PCR) analysis, the clinical and environmental A. baumannii isolates shared low genetic relatedness (∼60%). Multilocus sequence typing (MLST, Oxford scheme) indicated that the clinical A. baumannii were assigned to three sequence types (ST231, ST945 and ST848), while the environmental A. baumannii (excluding AB 14) were categorised into the novel ST2520. The majority of the clinical (excluding AB 5, CAB 11, CAC 37) and environmental (excluding AB 14 and AB 16) A. baumannii strains were then capable of phase variation with both the translucent (71.4%; 15/21) and opaque (95.2%; 20/21) colony phenotypes detected. The clinical isolates however, exhibited significantly (p < 0.05) higher biofilm formation capabilities (OD<sub>570</sub>: 2.094 ± 0.497). Moreover, the clinical isolates exhibited significantly (p < 0.05) higher resistance to first line antibiotics, with 92.3% (12/13) characterised as extensively drug resistant (XDR), whereas environmental A. baumannii exhibited increased antibiotic susceptibility with only 57.1% (4/7) characterised as multidrug resistant (MDR). The environmental isolate AB 14 was however, characterised as XDR. In addition, only five clinical A. baumannii isolates exhibited colistin resistance (38.5%; 5/13). The current study highlighted the differences in the genotypic, phenotypic, and antibiotic resistance profiles of clinical and environmental A. baumannii. Moreover, the environmental strains were assigned to the novel ST2520, which substantiates the existence of this opportunistic pathogen in extra-hospital reservoirs.	2022 Nov	Benjamin Havenga, Brandon Reyneke, Thando Ndlovu, Wesaal Khan	Microb Pathog
36466845	Insights into <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> protective immunity.	<i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> is a nosocomic opportunistic Gram-negative bacteria known for its extensive drug-resistant phenotype. <i>A. baumannii</i> hospital-acquired infections are major contributors to increased costs and mortality observed during the COVID-19 pandemic. With few effective antimicrobials available for treatment of this pathogen, immune-based therapy becomes an attractive strategy to combat multi-drug resistant <i>Acinetobacter</i> infection. Immunotherapeutics is a field of growing interest with advances in vaccines and monoclonal antibodies providing insight into the protective immune response required to successfully combat this pathogen. This review focuses on current knowledge describing the adaptive immune response to <i>A. baumannii</i>, the importance of antibody-mediated protection, developments in cell-mediated protection, and their respective therapeutic application going forward. With <i>A. baumannii</i>'s increasing resistance to most current antimicrobials, elucidating an effective host adaptive immune response is paramount in the guidance of future immunotherapeutic development.	2022	Sean Jeffreys, James P Chambers, Jieh-Juen Yu, Chiung-Yu Hung, Thomas Forsthuber, Bernard P Arulanandam	Front Immunol
36386691	<i>In vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> synergistic effect of chrysin in combination with colistin against <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>.	<i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> is an opportunistic pathogen that is primarily associated with nosocomial infections. With the rise in cases of acquired drug resistance, <i>A. baumannii</i> is gaining resistance to conventional antimicrobial drugs and even to the last line of antibiotics, such as colistin. Hence, the application of the synergistic combination of an antibiotic and a non-antibacterial agent is being contemplated as a new alternative therapeutic approach. Chrysin is a component of honey with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. In this study, we evaluated the antibacterial activity of chrysin in combination with colistin against <i>A. baumannii</i> both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>, as well as the cytotoxicity of chrysin with or without colistin. Our results revealed that chrysin and colistin exerted synergistic effects against <i>A. baumannii</i> by damaging the extracellular membrane and modifying the bacterial membrane potential. The chrysin/colistin combination group demonstrated an inhibitory effect on biofilm formation. In conclusion, it is expected that the synergy between these drugs can allow the use of a lower concentration of colistin for the treatment of <i>A. baumannii</i> infections, thereby reducing dose-dependent side effects. Thus, a combination therapy of chrysin/colistin may provide a new therapeutic option for controlling <i>A. baumannii</i> infections.	2022	Yining Zhao, Yan Liu, Luozhu Feng, Mengxin Xu, Hong Wen, Zhuocheng Yao, Shiyi Shi, Qing Wu, Cui Zhou, Jianming Cao, Tieli Zhou	Front Microbiol
37120784	Acinetobacter baumannii Bacteriophage: Progress in Isolation, Genome Sequencing, Preclinical Research, and Clinical Application.	Acinetobacter baumannii (A. baumannii) is a common nosocomial pathogen associated with serious clinical challenges owing to its rapidly increasing resistance to antibiotics. Due to their high host specificity and easy access to the natural environment, bacteriophages (phages) may serve as good antibacterial agents. Phage therapy has been successfully used to treat antibiotic-resistant A. baumannii infections. As a fundamental step before phage therapy, the characterization and sequencing of A. baumannii phages have been well studied. Until October 2022, 132 A. baumannii phages have been sequenced and studied, with their genomes ranging from 4 to 234 kb, and we summarize the characterized and sequenced A. baumannii phages. This review is a current and short overview that does not go into detail on the A. baumannii phages. In addition, preclinical studies and clinical applications of A. baumannii phages are also included.	2023 Apr	Yanqi Li, Shune Xiao, Guangtao Huang	Curr Microbiol
35720310	Promising <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> Vaccine Candidates and Drug Targets in Recent Years.	In parallel to the uncontrolled use of antibiotics, the emergence of multidrug-resistant bacteria, like <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>, has posed a severe threat. <i>A. baumannii</i> predominates in the nosocomial setting due to its ability to persist in hospitals and survive antibiotic treatment, thereby eventually leading to an increasing prevalence and mortality due to its infection. With the increasing spectra of drug resistance and the incessant collapse of newly discovered antibiotics, new therapeutic countermeasures have been in high demand. Hence, recent research has shown favouritism towards the long-term solution of designing vaccines. Therefore, being a realistic alternative strategy to combat this pathogen, anti-<i>A. Baumannii</i> vaccines research has continued unearthing various antigens with variable results over the last decade. Again, other approaches, including pan-genomics, subtractive proteomics, and reverse vaccination strategies, have shown promise for identifying promiscuous core vaccine candidates that resulted in chimeric vaccine constructs. In addition, the integration of basic knowledge of the pathobiology of this drug-resistant bacteria has also facilitated the development of effective multiantigen vaccines. As opposed to the conventional trial-and-error approach, incorporating the <i>in silico</i> methods in recent studies, particularly network analysis, has manifested a great promise in unearthing novel vaccine candidates from the <i>A. baumannii</i> proteome. Some studies have used multiple <i>A. baumannii</i> data sources to build the co-functional networks and analyze them by k-shell decomposition. Additionally, Whole Genomic Protein Interactome (GPIN) analysis has utilized a rational approach for identifying essential proteins and presenting them as vaccines effective enough to combat the deadly pathogenic threats posed by <i>A. baumannii</i>. Others have identified multiple immune nodes using network-based centrality measurements for synergistic antigen combinations for different vaccination strategies. Protein-protein interactions have also been inferenced utilizing structural approaches, such as molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation. Similar workflows and technologies were employed to unveil novel <i>A. baumannii</i> drug targets, with a similar trend in the increasing influx of <i>in silico</i> techniques. This review integrates the latest knowledge on the development of <i>A. baumannii</i> vaccines while highlighting the <i>in silico</i> methods as the future of such exploratory research. In parallel, we also briefly summarize recent advancements in <i>A. baumannii</i> drug target research.	2022	Yong Chiang Tan, Chandrajit Lahiri	Front Immunol
36111747	<i>Acinetobacter</i> <i>baumannii</i>-induced infective endocarditis: new insights into pathophysiology and antibiotic resistance mechanisms.	Infective endocarditis (IE), characterized by inflammation of the endocardial surface of the heart and its valves, results from infections caused by <i>Staphylococcus</i>, <i>Streptococcus</i> and <i>Acinetobacter</i> species and less commonly fungi. <i>Acinetobacter</i>-induced IE is a relatively rare condition with significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Notably, its mortality rate is greater than that of endocarditis induced by the <i>Haemophilus</i> species, <i>Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans</i>, <i>Cardiobacterium hominis</i>, <i>Eikenella corrodens</i> and <i>Kingella kingae</i>. Although it is rare, <i>Acinetobacter</i>-induced IE caused by <i>A. baumannii</i> might bring unique therapeutic challenges such as increased antibiotic resistance. Therefore, it is vital to understand perfectly the possible pathophysiologic and antibiotic resistance mechanisms adopted by <i>A. baumannii</i> during IE. This review discusses the probable underlying pathomechanisms involved in <i>A. baumannii</i>-induced IE and highlights the potential antibiotic resistance mechanisms, suggesting therapeutic targets for <i>A. baumannii</i>-induced IE.	2022 Nov	Innocent Afeke, Joseph Adu-Amankwaah, Mary Nyarko, Aisha Bushi, Anthony S Ablordey, Priscilla A Duah, Prosperl I Wowui, Verner N Orish	Future Microbiol
35303613	Structural and biochemical characterization of Acinetobacter baumannii ZnuA.	Acinetobacter baumannii is a Gram-negative nosocomial pathogen associated with significant disease. Crucial to the survival and pathogenesis of A. baumannii is the ability to acquire essential micronutrients such as Zn(II). Recruitment of Zn(II) by A. baumannii is mediated, at least in part, by the periplasmic solute-binding protein ZnuA and the ATP-binding cassette transporter ZnuBC. Here, we combined genomic, biochemical, and structural approaches to characterize A. baumannii AB5075_UW ZnuA. Bioinformatic analyses using a diverse collection of A. baumannii genomes determined that ZnuA is highly conserved, with the binding site comprised by three strictly conserved histidine residues. The structure of metal-free ZnuA was determined at 2.1 Å resolution, with molecular dynamics analyses revealing loop α2β2, which harbors the putative Zn(II)-coordinating residue His41, to be highly mobile in the metal-free state. The contribution of the putative binding site histidine residues to Zn(II) interaction was further probed by mutagenesis. Analysis of ZnuA mutant variants was performed by quantitative metal binding assays, differential scanning fluorimetry, and affinity measurements, which showed that all three histidine residues contributed to Zn(II)-recruitment, albeit to different extents. Collectively, these analyses provide insight into the mechanism of Zn(II)-binding by A. baumannii ZnuA and expand our understanding of the functional diversity of Zn(II)-recruiting proteins.	2022 Jun	Saleh Alquethamy, Katherine Ganio, Zhenyao Luo, Sheikh I Hossain, Andrew J Hayes, Thomas Ve, Mark R Davies, Evelyne Deplazes, Boštjan Kobe, Christopher A McDevitt	J Inorg Biochem
36713441	Subunit vaccines for <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>.	<i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> is a gram-negative bacterium and a crucial opportunistic pathogen in hospitals. <i>A. baumannii</i> infection has become a challenging problem in clinical practice due to the increasing number of multidrug-resistant strains and their prevalence worldwide. Vaccines are effective tools to prevent and control <i>A. baumannii</i> infection. Many researchers are studying subunit vaccines against <i>A. baumannii</i>. Subunit vaccines have the advantages of high purity, safety, and stability, ease of production, and highly targeted induced immune responses. To date, no <i>A. baumannii</i> subunit vaccine candidate has entered clinical trials. This may be related to the easy degradation of subunit vaccines <i>in vivo</i> and weak immunogenicity. Using adjuvants or delivery vehicles to prepare subunit vaccines can slow down degradation and improve immunogenicity. The common immunization routes include intramuscular injection, subcutaneous injection, intraperitoneal injection and mucosal vaccination. The appropriate immunization method can also enhance the immune effect of subunit vaccines. Therefore, selecting an appropriate adjuvant and immunization method is essential for subunit vaccine research. This review summarizes the past exploration of <i>A. baumannii</i> subunit vaccines, hoping to guide current and future research on these vaccines.	2022	Ning Yang, Xiao Jin, Chenghua Zhu, Fenglin Gao, Zheqi Weng, Xingran Du, Ganzhu Feng	Front Immunol

36272902	Treatment of Acinetobacter baumannii severe infections.	Acinetobacter baumannii is a Gram-negative, multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogen that causes nosocomial infections, especially in intensive care units (ICUs) and immunocompromised patients. A. baumannii has developed a broad spectrum of antimicrobial resistance, associated with a higher mortality rate among infected patients compared with other non-baumannii species. In terms of clinical impact, resistant strains are associated with increases in both in-hospital length of stay and mortality. A. baumannii can cause a variety of infections, especially ventilator-associated pneumonia, bacteremia, and skin wound infections, among others. The most common risk factors for the acquisition of MDR A. baumannii are previous antibiotic use, mechanical ventilation, length of ICU and hospital stay, severity of illness, and use of medical devices. Current efforts are focused on addressing all the antimicrobial resistance mechanisms described in A. baumannii, with the objective of identifying the most promising therapeutic scheme.	2022 Dec	R Reina, C León-Moya, J Garnacho-Montero	Med Intensiva (Engl Ed)
35873147	Neutrophil and Macrophage Response in Acinetobacter Baumannii Infection and Their Relationship to Lung Injury.	Acinetobacter baumannii (AB) infection has become a threat to global public health. AB is one of the main pathogens causing nosocomial infections, especially ventilator-associated pneumonia. AB easily develops resistance against a variety of antibiotics, which makes the treatment of AB infections difficult. Therefore, it is necessary to study new treatment plans like anti-infection immunity. Both animal models of AB infection and <i>in vitro</i> cell experiments show that macrophages are activated in the early stage of the immune response and regulate the recruitment of neutrophils, thus playing a role in clearing AB. AB components and the immune responses they induce can lead to injury of the infected organ, mostly in the lungs. Understanding the response of innate immunity to ABs at different stages after infection and the relationship between the response and lung injury can help to develop new immunotherapy methods and prevent lung injury. This article provides a comprehensive review of the response of neutrophils and macrophages to AB infection and their association with lung injury to develop effective therapies for AB infection and prevent lung injury.	2022	Zhaojun Liu, Wei Xu	Front Cell Infect Microbiol
36551450	<i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> Resistance to Sulbactam/Durlobactam: A Systematic Review.	Infections caused by carbapenem-resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> (CRAB) have limited therapeutic options. Sulbactam-durlobactam is a combination of two βlactamase inhibitors with activity against CRAB under phase 3 clinical investigation. We performed a systematic review on in vitro studies reporting <i>A. baumannii</i> resistances against sulbactam/durlobactam. We considered "resistant" species to be those with MIC ≥ 8 mg/L. Ten studies were included in the review (9754 tested isolates). Overall, 2.3% of <i>A. baumannii</i> were resistant to sulbactam/durlobactam, and this percentage rose to 3.4% among CRAB subgroups and to 3.7% among colistin-resistant strains. Resistance was 100% among metallo β-lactamase-producing strains. Overall, in 12.5% of cases, sulbactam/durlobactam resistance was associated with the production of NDM-1, in 31.7% of cases with the substitutions in the PBP3 determinants, and in the remaining cases the resistance mechanism was unknown. In conclusion, <i>A. baumannii</i> resistance towards sulbactam/durlobactam is limited, except for MBL-producing strains.	2022 Dec	Luigi Principe, Stefano Di Bella, Jacopo Conti, Mariagrazia Perilli, Alessandra Piccirilli, Cristina Mussini, Giuliana Decorti	Antibiotics (Basel)
35766493	Acinetobacter baumannii Sampled from Cattle and Pigs Represent Novel Clones.	Acinetobacter baumannii is a very important human pathogen. Nonetheless, we know very little about nonhuman isolates of A. baumannii. Here, we determine the genomic identity of 15 Scottish cattle and pig isolates, as well as their antibiotic and virulence genetic determinants, and compare them with 148 genomes from the main human clinical international clones. Our results demonstrate that cattle and pig isolates represent novel clones well separated from the major international clones. Furthermore, these new clones showed fewer antibiotic resistance genes and may have fewer virulence genes than human clinical isolates. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Over the last decades, huge amounts of information have been obtained for clinical isolates of A. baumannii and the clones they belong to. In contrast, very little is known about the genomic identity and the genomic basis for virulence and resistance of animal isolates. To fulfil this gap, we conducted a genomic epidemiology study of 15 Scottish cattle and pig isolates in the context of almost 150 genomes belonging to the main international clones of A. baumannii. Our findings show that these animal isolates represent novel clones clearly different from the major international clones. Furthermore, these new clones are distinct in nature considering both antibiotic resistance and virulence when compared with their human clinical counterparts.	2022 Aug	Valeria Mateo-Estrada, Leila Vali, Ahmed Hamouda, Benjamin A Evans, Santiago Castillo-Ramírez	Microbiol Spectr
36031361	Emergence and multi-lineages of carbapenemase-producing Acinetobacter baumannii-calcoaceticus complex from canine and feline origins.	The carbapenemase-producing Acinetobacter baumannii is an important opportunistic bacterium and frequently causes hospital-acquired infections in humans. It also has increasingly been reported in veterinary medicine. This study illustrates multiple clones of carbapenemase-producing A. baumannii disseminating and causing diseases in dogs and cats in Thailand. Between 2016 and 2020, 44 A. baumannii and two A. pittii isolates exhibiting imipenem resistance (MIC≥16 μg/mL) from diagnostic samples were characterized by Pasteur multilocus sequence typing (MLST), sequence grouping (SG), repetitive extragenic palindromic element (rep)-PCR fingerprint analysis and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) profiling. All isolates contained bla<sub>OXA-23</sub> in the Tn2006 family, and A. baumannii showed the sequence type (ST) 16 (14/44), ST149 (12/44), ST25 (6/44), ST2 (4/44), ST1581 (3/44), ST23 (2/44), ST1575 (1/44) and ST1576 (1/44). DNA fingerprint analysis and SG illustrated clonal relationships in the STs and its single locus variants, and AMR gene profiles, including tetracycline and aminoglycoside resistance genes, showed minor variations in the clones. The findings suggest that bla<sub>OXA-23</sub> has been spread in multiple clones of A. baumannii and A. pittii from canine and feline hosts. With the collection of multiple AMR genes and intrinsic resistance, antimicrobial options are limited for treatment, and pets can be a potential reservoir of extensively drug-resistant, carbapenemase-producing A. baumannii in the community. Epidemiological tracking by passive and active surveillance in animals, veterinary personnel and hospital environment and preventive measurements should be promoted to decrease the risk of infection and transmission to humans.	2022 Oct	Chavin Leelapsawas, Jitrapa Yindee, Naiyaphat Nittayasut, Surawit Chueahiran, Pongthai Boonkham, Nipattra Suanpairintr, Pattrarat Chanchaithong	J Vet Med Sci
35604222	Light Regulates <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> Chromosomal and pAB3 Plasmid Genes at 37°C.	The opportunistic pathogen A. baumannii has a remarkable capacity to persist in the hospital environment and cause devastating human infections. This capacity can be attributed partly to the sensing and regulatory systems that enable this pathogen to modify its physiology based on environmental cues. One of the signals that A. baumannii senses and responds to is light through the sensing and regulatory roles of the BlsA photoreceptor protein in cells cultured at temperatures below 30°C. This report presents evidence that a light stimulon is operational at 37°C, a condition at which the BlsA production and activity are drastically impaired. Global transcriptional analysis showed that the 37°C light stimulon includes the differential expression of chromosomal genes encoding a wide range of functions that are known to be involved in the adaptation to different metabolic conditions, as well as virulence and persistence in the host and the medical environment. Unexpectedly, the 37°C light stimulon also includes the differential expression of conjugation functions encoded by pAB3 plasmid genes. Our work further demonstrates that the TetR1 and H-NS regulators encoded by this conjugative plasmid control the expression of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> resistance and surface motility, respectively. Furthermore, our data showed that pAB3 has an overall negative effect on the expression of these phenotypes and plays no significant virulence role. Although the nature of the bacterial factors and the mechanisms by which the regulation is attained at 37°C remain unknown, taken together, our work expands the current knowledge about light sensing and gene regulation in A. baumannii. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> As a facultative pathogen, Acinetobacter baumannii persists in various environments by sensing different environmental cues, including light. This report provides evidence of light-dependent regulation at 37°C of the expression of genes coding for a wide range of functions, including those involved in the conjugation of the pAB3 plasmid. Although this plasmid affects the expression of virulence traits when tested under laboratory conditions, it does not have a significant impact when tested using <i>ex vivo</i> and <i>in vivo</i> experimental models. These findings provide a better understanding of the interplay between light regulation and plasmid persistence in the pathobiology of A. baumannii.	2022 Jun	Mariah S Squire, Hope A Townsend, Aminul Islam, Luis A Actis	J Bacteriol
35630494	Biological Control of <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>: In Vitro and In Vivo Activity, Limitations, and Combination Therapies.	The survival, proliferation, and epidemic spread of <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> (<i>A. baumannii</i>) in hospital settings is associated with several characteristics, including resistance to many commercially available antibiotics as well as the expression of multiple virulence mechanisms. This severely limits therapeutic options, with increased mortality and morbidity rates recorded worldwide. The World Health Organisation, thus, recognises <i>A. baumannii</i> as one of the critical pathogens that need to be prioritised for the development of new antibiotics or treatment. The current review will thus provide a brief overview of the antibiotic resistance and virulence mechanisms associated with <i>A. baumannii</i>'<i>s</i> "persist and resist strategy". Thereafter, the potential of biological control agents including secondary metabolites such as biosurfactants [lipopeptides (surfactin and serrawettin) and glycolipids (rhamnolipid)] as well as predatory bacteria (<i>Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus</i>) and bacteriophages to directly target <i>A. baumannii</i>, will be discussed in terms of their in vitro and in vivo activity. In addition, limitations and corresponding mitigations strategies will be outlined, including curtailing resistance development using combination therapies, product stabilisation, and large-scale (up-scaling) production.	2022 May	Benjamin Havenga, Brandon Reyneke, Monique Waso-Reyneke, Thando Ndlovu, Sehaam Khan, Wesaal Khan	Microorganisms
37211625	<i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> subunit vaccines: recent progress and challenges.	<i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> is a Gram-negative, opportunistic pathogen that causes nosocomial infection with a high mortality rate in immunocompromised individuals. With the frequent emergence of multidrug-resistant <i>A. baumannii</i> strains that have rapidly gained resistance to most antibiotics, an extensive search for an effective <i>A. baumannii</i> vaccine is ongoing. Over the decade, many subunit vaccine candidates were identified using reverse vaccinology and <i>in vivo</i> animal studies for validation. Nineteen subunit vaccine candidates with a wide range of efficacy, from 14% to 100% preclinical survival rates, were included in this review. This article provides an updated review of several outer membrane proteins (Omp) that emerged as vaccine candidates with great potential, including OmpA, Omp34, Omp22 and BamA, based on their high conservancy, antigenicity, and immune protection against <i>A. baumannii</i> infection. However, there is still no licenced <i>A. baumannii</i> vaccine currently due to several practical issues that have yet to be resolved, such as inconsistencies between validation studies, antigen variability and insolubility. Moving forward, much investigation and innovation are still required to tackle these challenges for the regulatory approval of an <i>A. baumannii</i> subunit vaccine, including standardisation of immunisation study parameters, improving antigen solubility and the incorporation of nucleic acid vaccine technology.	2023 May	Yi Teng Lau, Hock Siew Tan	Crit Rev Microbiol
37200758	Genotypic Patterns of Multidrug-Resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>: A Systematic Review.	<i>Acinetobacter baumannii (A. baumannii)</i> is one of the most common bacteria in nosocomial infections. Inappropriate usage of antibiotics has led to expanding emergence resistance to <i>A. baumannii</i> as a multidrug-resistant (MDR) strain. Empirical antibiotic therapy is necessary to evaluate the resistant gene pattern of MDR <i>A. baumannii</i>. For this purpose, the present study evaluated the resistance genes pattern of MDR <i>A. baumannii</i> collected from hospitalized patients using a genotypic diagnostic technique. To find evidence related to the study objectives, databases were searched such as Google Scholar, Web of Science, Science Direct, PubMed, and Scopus from 2000 to 2022, with specified keywords in the title and text of the articles. Articles were included based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. The mentioned database displayed 284 articles. After screening, 65 eligible articles were included. The results showed that various b-lactamases genes, aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes (AMEs) genes, and pump-expressing genes are resistance gene patterns in MDR <i>A. baumannii</i> isolates. MDR <i>A. baumannii</i> has significantly become resistant to b-lactams, carbapenems, and aminoglycosides.	2023	Golnar Rahimzadeh, Mohammad S Rezai, Fereshteh Farshidi	Adv Biomed Res
37123129	Immunological Evaluation of Individuals Infected with <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>.	<i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> (<i>A. baumannii</i>) is a spherical rod-shaped Gram-negative non-lactose fermenting (Coccobacilli, Aerobic bacteria) bacteria. It is a member of the <i>Moraxellacea</i> family. <i>A. baumannii</i> is a pathogenic, opportunistic organism that infects humans in society and hospitals. In particular, patients with immune system defects are at risk, especially those with burn infections and those hospitalized in intensive care (ICU). It plays a vital role in many illnesses, including septicemia, pneumonia, meningitis, soft tissues, skin infection, endocarditis, and urinary tract infection (UTI). The current study included immunological evaluation of infection with <i>A. baumannii</i>. In the current study, 150 blood samples were obtained as follows: 100 blood samples were collected from infected individuals with <i>A. baumannii</i> admitted to hospitals in Baghdad. Fifty blood samples were obtained from healthy individuals and considered as the control. 10 ml of blood samples were collected from the venous blood of the participants. <i>A. baumannii</i> was collected and isolated from infected patients and diagnosed by traditional methods, using different culture media (MacConkey agar, blood agar, and Chromogenetic agar) and by biochemical assays, then the bacteria diagnosis was confirmed using the VITEK 2 ID-GN cards. Microscopic examination and culture diagnosis of bacteria were conducted, and the diagnosis was confirmed by complete biochemical examinations using VITEK2 Compact System. Assessments included the serum level of IL-17A and TNF-α for hospitalized patients infected with <i>A. baumannii</i>. The study recorded a significant increase in the serum level of IL-17A for patients infected with <i>A. baumannii</i> (479.83±26.21 pg/ml) compared to control subjects (69.32±4.53 pg/ml). The recorded data showed a significant increase in the serum level of TNF-α for patients infected with <i>A. baumannii</i> (98.05±28.89 pg/ml) compared to control (1.40±25.12 pg/ml).	2022 Oct	S Manfi Ahmed, K Hashim Yaseen, M Mohammed Mahmood	Arch Razi Inst
36386699	Molecular typing and antibiotic resistance patterns among clinical isolates of <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> recovered from burn patients in Tehran, Iran.	<i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> (<i>A. baumannii</i>) is now considered a highly resistant pathogen to various types of antibiotics. Therefore, tracking the source of its prevalence and continuous control is crucial. This study aimed to determine antibiotic resistance and perform various molecular typing methods on clinical isolates of <i>A. baumannii</i> isolated from hospitalized burn patients in Shahid Motahari Burn Hospital, Tehran, Iran. Hospital isolates were confirmed by phenotypic and molecular methods. Then the sensitivity to different antibiotics was determined using the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) method. In order to perform molecular typing, three-locus dual assay multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR), multiple-locus variable-number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA), and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) methods were used. Among the 60 isolates collected, the frequencies of multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) isolates were 90 and 10%, respectively. The most effective antibiotics were colistin with 100% and tigecycline with 83.33% sensitivity. Isolates were 100% resistant to piperacillin/tazobactam and cephalosporins, and 68.3% were resistant to carbapenem. The results of multiplex PCR showed five groups that international clone I (IC I) and IC II were the most common. The MLVA method identified 34 MLVA types (MTs), 5 clusters, and 25 singletons. Multilocus sequence typing results for tigecycline-resistant isolates showed seven different sequence types (STs). Increasing antibiotic resistance in <i>A. baumannii</i> isolates requires careful management to control and prevent the occurrence of the pre-antibiotic era. The results of this study confirm that the population structure of <i>A. baumannii</i> isolates has a high diversity. More extensive studies are needed in Iran to better understand the epidemiology of <i>A. baumannii</i>.	2022	Abbas Maleki, Vahab Hassan Kaviar, Maryam Koupaei, Mohammad Hossein Haddadi, Behrooz Sadeghi Kalani, Hassan Valadbeigi, Somayeh Karamolahi, Nazanin Omidi, Marziyeh Hashemian, Nourkhoda Sadeghifard, Jasem Mohamadi, Mohsen Heidary, Saeed Khoshnood	Front Microbiol
36074653	<i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>-<i>calcoaceticus</i> Complex-associated Orbital Cellulitis: A Case Report and Literature Review.	<i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>-<i>calcoaceticus</i> complex is emerging as one of the most common causes of hospital-acquired infection globally. We present a case of orbital cellulitis caused by the <i>A. baumannii-calcoaceticus</i> complex. A 73-year-old Chinese woman with a history of rheumatoid arthritis presented with subacute onset of right upper eyelid swelling for 1 week. Computer tomography revealed a post-septal soft tissue lesion located at the right superior orbit that was enhanced with contrast, compressing on the superior aspect of the globe. Anterior orbitotomy with incisional biopsy of the right superior orbital lesion was performed, and histopathological examination was consistent with nonspecific inflammatory mass. The microbiological culture of the specimen yielded <i>A. calcoaceticus</i> and <i>A. baumannii</i> complex, which was sensitive to ciprofloxacin, ampicillin, and gentamicin. The infection resolved after a 1-week course of intravenous augmentin. Ophthalmologists should be alert to the possibility of patients having <i>A. baumannii</i> and <i>A. calcoaceticus</i> in periorbital cellulitis.	2022 Sep	Kenneth K H Lai, Sarah Wang, Andrew K T Kuk, Alan Tsang, Jacqueline H C Tai, Callie K L Ko	Ocul Immunol Inflamm
35853519	Contamination of healthcare environment by carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii.	Acinetobacter baumannii is frequently found on floors, devices, and environmental sites in hospitals and can survive for prolonged periods and accumulate resistance determinants. The infection and presence of carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii (CRAB) in patients is associated with increased mortality, severe clinical outcomes, and longer lengths of stay at hospitals. This review addresses contamination by CRAB in corporal surfaces of patients and healthcare workers and environmental sites at healthcare-related settings. We summarized published data during the last decade on potential reservoirs for CRAB, including contamination frequency and the involved resistance mechanisms, and some measures associated with the elimination of CRAB from hospital surfaces.	2022 Dec	Flora Cruz-López, Adrián Martínez-Meléndez, Licet Villarreal-Treviño, Rayo Morfín-Otero, Héctor Maldonado-Garza, Elvira Garza-González	Am J Med Sci
36253556	Acinetobacter baumannii Biofilm Formation: Association with Antimicrobial Resistance and Prolonged Survival under Desiccation.	Biofilm-forming multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii has emerged as a global pathogen. This study investigated the impact of biofilm formation by A. baumannii on antimicrobial resistance and prolonged survival under desiccation, which is essential for effective infection control of A. baumannii in hospital settings. Seventy-eight clinical isolates of A. baumannii were identified, and antibiotic susceptibility profiles were assessed. All the isolates were investigated for their biofilm-forming abilities at 24 and 48 h. The biofilm inhibitory concentrations of antibiotics were evaluated for selected biofilm-forming isolates to determine the influence of biofilm on antibiotic tolerance. The impact of biofilm formation on desiccation tolerance was also evaluated for up to 48 days. The results revealed that out of 78 A. baumannii clinical isolates, 83% were MDR and 17% non-MDR. Overall, 79% of isolates formed high biofilm after 24 h. The extent of biofilm formation gets significantly increased after 48 h, and 87% of isolates formed high biofilm. It was observed that eradicating mature biofilm requires up to a thousandfold higher concentration of antibiotics than MICs, and biofilm-forming isolates can survive for a prolonged period under desiccation. In conclusion, our findings revealed that both MDR and non-MDR isolates of A. baumannii could form biofilms on abiotic surfaces. A. baumannii biofilms contribute to endurance in the presence of antimicrobials and desiccation conditions, which are significant trouble for hospital patient care management. The present findings may offer insights for developing preventive measures to tackle biofilm-associated A. baumannii infection.	2022 Oct	Monika Choudhary, Rahul Shrivastava, Jitendraa Vashistt	Curr Microbiol
36460749	The association between Acinetobacter baumannii infections and the COVID-19 pandemic in an intensive care unit.	We aimed to describe the increased rate of Acinetobacter baumannii infections during the COVID-19 pandemic and define its significance within the last five years. This study was performed in a tertiary hospital with 280 beds and included all patients infected with A. baumannii in the intensive care unit between January 1, 2018, and June 30, 2022. A. baumannii-infected patients in the intensive care unit 27 months before the pandemic and 27 months during the pandemic were included. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis was performed to assess clonal relatedness. The infection control measures were specified based on the findings and targeted elimination. In total, 5718 patients were admitted to the intensive care unit from January 1st, 2018, to June 30th, 2022. A. baumannii infection was detected in 81 patients. Compared to the pre-pandemic era, the rate of A. baumannii infection during the pandemic was 1.90 times higher (OR: 1.90, 95% CI: [1.197, 3.033]). Clonality assessment of multidrug-resistant A. baumannii samples revealed eight clusters with one main cluster comprising 14/27 isolates between 2021 and 2022. The case fatality rate of the pre-pandemic and pandemic era was not different statistically (83.33% vs. 81.48%, p = 0.835). Univariate analysis revealed the association of mechanical ventilation (p = 0.002) and bacterial growth in tracheal aspirate (p = 0.001) with fatality. During the COVID-19 pandemic, potential deficits in infection control measures may lead to persistent nosocomial outbreaks. In this study, the introduction of enhanced and customized infection control measures has resulted in the containment of an A. baumannii outbreak.	2022 Dec	Jale Boral, Zeliha Genç, Fatihan Pınarlık, Güz Ekinci, Mert A Kuskucu, Pelin İrkören, Mahir Kapmaz, Süda Tekin, Nahit Çakar, Evren Şentürk, Fatma Yurdakul, Bilge Dikenelli, Fusun Can, Onder Ergonul	Sci Rep

36374776	Promising targets for immunotherapeutic approaches against Acinetobacter baumannii.	Acinetobacter baumannii is an opportunistic pathogen associated with the occurrence of outbreaks in hospital settings, especially in Intensive Care Units (ICUs). Pneumonia, septicemias, urinary tract infections, and recurrent infections associated with the use of hospital devices are some of the most frequent complications. Due to the increase of A. baumannii strains resistant to multiple antimicrobials, associated with their high capacity to form biofilms on biotic and abiotic surfaces, the therapeutic strategies routinely applied have become increasingly restricted and ineffective, resulting in high mortality rates. Many studies have focused on the development of new therapeutic approaches, mainly non-antibiotic-based. Polyclonal (pAb) and monoclonal (mAb) antibodies are increasingly cited in the literature as alternative strategies to the use of antimicrobial drugs and are evaluated for the prevention and treatment of these infections. In this context, this review aimed to synthesize the main strategies based on the use of antibodies that are being evaluated for the control of A. baumannii infections. Here, we describe the main A. baumannii antigenic targets used in studies to assess their potential to induce the formation of antibodies and their possible application in immunotherapy strategies.	2022 Dec	Stella Buchhorn de Freitas, Daiane Drawanz Hartwig	Microb Pathog
36138822	Virulence Characteristics and Emerging Therapies for Biofilm-Forming <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>: A Review.	<i>Acinetobacter</i> species is one of the most prevailing nosocomial pathogens with a potent ability to develop antimicrobial resistance. It commonly causes infections where there is a prolonged utilization of medical devices such as CSF shunts, catheters, endotracheal tubes, and similar. There are several strains of <i>Acinetobacter</i> (A) species (spp), among which the majority are pathogenic to humans, but <i>A. baumannii</i> are entirely resistant to several clinically available antibiotics. The crucial mechanism that renders them a multidrug-resistant strain is their potent ability to synthesize biofilms. Biofilms provide ample opportunity for the microorganisms to withstand the harsh environment and further cause chronic infections. Several studies have enumerated multiple physiological and virulence factors responsible for the production and maintenance of biofilms. To further enhance our understanding of this pathogen, in this review, we discuss its taxonomy, pathogenesis, current treatment options, global resistance rates, mechanisms of its resistance against various groups of antimicrobials, and future therapeutics.	2022 Sep	Karma G Dolma, Rachana Khati, Alok K Paul, Mohammed Rahmatullah, Maria de Lourdes Pereira, Polrat Wilairatana, Bidita Khandelwal, Chamma Gupta, Deepan Gautam, Madhu Gupta, Ramesh K Goyal, Christophe Wiart, Veeranoot Nissapatorn	Biology (Basel)
36439795	Carbapenem-resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>: A challenge in the intensive care unit.	Carbapenem-resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> (CRAB) has become one of the leading causes of healthcare-associated infections globally, particularly in intensive care units (ICUs). Cross-transmission of microorganisms between patients and the hospital environment may play a crucial role in ICU-acquired CRAB colonization and infection. The control and treatment of CRAB infection in ICUs have been recognized as a global challenge because of its multiple-drug resistance. The main concern is that CRAB infections can be disastrous for ICU patients if currently existing limited therapeutic alternatives fail in the future. Therefore, the colonization, infection, transmission, and resistance mechanisms of CRAB in ICUs need to be systematically studied. To provide a basis for prevention and control countermeasures for CRAB infection in ICUs, we present an overview of research on CRAB in ICUs, summarize clinical infections and environmental reservoirs, discuss the drug resistance mechanism and homology of CRAB in ICUs, and evaluate contemporary treatment and control strategies.	2022	Yuan Jiang, Yinhuan Ding, Yueshuai Wei, Chunxia Jian, Jinbo Liu, Zhangrui Zeng	Front Microbiol

36552354	Characterization of <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> Isolated from Raw Milk.	<i>Acinetobacter baumannii (A. baumannii)</i> is an opportunistic pathogen associated with nosocomial infections. In this study, 100 raw milk samples were collected from Qena, Egypt, and subjected to conventional and molecular assays to determine the presence of <i>A. baumannii</i> and investigate their antimicrobial resistance and biofilm formation. Our findings revealed that, among the 100 samples, <i>Acinetobacter</i> spp. were found in 13 samples based on CHROM agar results. We further characterized them using <i>rpo</i>B and <i>16S-23SrRNA</i> sequencing and <i>gyr</i>B multiplex PCR analysis and confirmed that 9 out of the 13 <i>Acinetobacter</i> spp. isolates were <i>A. baumannii</i> and 4 were other species. The <i>A. baumannii</i> isolates were resistant to β-lactam drugs, including cefotaxime (44%), ampicillin-sulbactam and levofloxacin (33.3% for each), imipenem, meropenem and aztreonam (22.2% for each). We observed different antimicrobial resistance patterns, with a multi-antibiotic resistant (MAR) index ranging from 0.2 to 0.3. According to the PCR results, <i>bla<sub>OXA-51</sub></i> and <i>bla<sub>OXA-23</sub></i> genes were amplified in 100% and 55.5% of the <i>A. baumannii</i> isolates, respectively, while the <i>bla<sub>OXA-58</sub></i> gene was not amplified. Furthermore, the metallo-β-lactamases (MBL) genes <i>bla<sub>IMP</sub></i> and <i>bla<sub>NDM</sub></i> were found in 11.1% and 22.2% of isolates, respectively, while <i>bla<sub>VIM</sub></i> was not amplified. Additionally, eight <i>A. baumannii</i> isolates (88.8%) produced black-colored colonies on Congo red agar, demonstrating their biofilm production capacity. These results showed that, besides other foodborne pathogens, raw milk should also be examined for <i>A. baumannii</i>, which could be a public health concern.	2022 Dec	Hams M A Mohamed, Hanan H Abd-Elhafeez, Omar A Al-Jabr, Mona A El-Zamkan	Biology (Basel)
36119417	Plasmid-Mediated Fluoroquinolone Resistance in <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> and <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>.	<b>Introduction</b>   <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> and <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> are important pathogens in health care-associated infections. Fluoroquinolone resistance has emerged in these pathogens. In this study, we aimed to determine the occurrence of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance (PMQR) determinants ( <i>qnrA</i> , <i>qnrB</i> , <i>qnrS</i> , <i>aac(6')-Ib-cr</i> , <i>oqxAB</i> , and <i>qepA</i> ) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and the transmissibility of plasmid-borne resistance determinants in clinical isolates of <i>P. aeruginosa</i> and <i>A. baumannii</i> . <b>Materials and Methods</b>  The study included <i>P. aeruginosa</i> (85) and <i>A. baumannii</i> (45) which were nonduplicate, clinically significant, and ciprofloxacin resistant. Antibiotic susceptibility testing was done by disk diffusion method for other antimicrobial agents, namely amikacin, ceftazidime, piperacillin/tazobactam, ofloxacin, levofloxacin, and imipenem. Minimum inhibitory concentration of ciprofloxacin was determined. Efflux pump activity was evaluated using carbonyl-cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP). The presence of PMQR genes was screened by PCR amplification. Transferability of PMQR genes was determined by conjugation experiment, and plasmid-based replicon typing was performed. <b>Results</b>  Resistance to other classes of antimicrobial agents was as follows: ceftazidime (86.9%), piperacillin/tazobactam (73.8%), imipenem (69.2%), and amikacin (63.8%). The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC)50 and MIC90 for ciprofloxacin were 64 and greater than or equal to 256 µg/mL, respectively. There was a reduction in MIC for 37 (28.4%) isolates with CCCP. In <i>P. aeruginosa</i> , 12 (14.1%) isolates harbored <i>qnrB</i> , 12 (14.1%) <i>qnrS</i> , 9 (10.5%) both <i>qnrB</i> and <i>qnrS</i> , 66 (77.6%) <i>aac(6')-Ib-cr</i> , and 3 (3.5%) <i>oqxAB</i> gene. In <i>A. baumannii</i> , <i>qnrB</i> was detected in 2 (4.4%), 1 (2.2%) harbored both the <i>qnrA</i> and <i>qnrS</i> , 1 isolate harbored <i>qnrB</i> and <i>qnrS</i> , 21 (46.6%) <i>aac(6')-Ib-cr</i> , and 1 (2.2%) isolate harbored <i>oqxAB</i> gene. Notably, <i>qepA</i> gene was not detected in any of the study isolates. Conjugation experiments revealed that 12 (9.2%) were transferable. Of the transconjugants, seven (58.3%) belonged to IncFII type plasmid replicon, followed by four (33.3%) IncA/C and one (8.3%) IncFIC type. <b>Conclusion</b>  The plasmid-mediated resistance <i>aac(6')-Ib-cr</i> gene is primarily responsible for mediating fluoroquinolone resistance in clinical isolates of <i>P</i> . <i>aeruginosa</i> and <i>A. baumannii</i> . The predominant plasmid type is IncFII.	2022 Sep	Geetha P Venkataramana, Aishwarya K V Lalitha, Shanthi Mariappan, Uma Sekar	J Lab Physicians
35652489	The carnitine degradation pathway of Acinetobacter baumannii and its role in virulence.	The opportunistic human pathogen Acinetobacter baumannii can grow with carnitine but its metabolism, regulation and role in virulence remained elusive. Recently, we identified a carnitine transporter encoded by a gene closely associated with potential carnitine degradation genes. Among those is a gene coding for a putative d-malate dehydrogenase (Mdh). Deletion of the mdh gene led to a loss of growth with carnitine but not l-malate; growth with d-malate was strongly reduced. Therefore, it is hypothesized that d-malate is formed during carnitine oxidation and further oxidized to CO<sub>2</sub> and pyruvate and, that not, as previously suggested, l-malate is the product and funnelled directly into the TCA cycle. Mutant analyses revealed that the hydrolase in this cluster funnels acetylcarnitine into the degradation pathway by deacetylation. A transcriptional regulator CarR bound in a concentration-dependent manner to the intergenic region between the mdh gene, the first gene of the carnitine catabolic operon and the carR gene in the presence and absence of carnitine. Both carnitine and d-malate induced CarR-dependent expression of the carnitine operon. Infection studies with Galleria mellonella larvae demonstrated a strong increase in virulence by addition of carnitine indicating that carnitine degradation plays a pivotal role in virulence of A. baumannii.	2022 Sep	Jennifer Breisch, Clemens Schumm, Anja Poehlein, Rolf Daniel, Beate Averhoff	Environ Microbiol
35880884	Acinetobacter baumannii Catabolizes Ethanolamine in the Absence of a Metabolosome and Converts Cobinamide into Adenosylated Cobamides.	Acinetobacter baumannii is an opportunistic pathogen typically associated with hospital-acquired infections. Our understanding of the metabolism and physiology of A. baumannii is limited. Here, we report that A. baumannii uses ethanolamine (EA) as the sole source of nitrogen and can use this aminoalcohol as a source of carbon and energy if the expression of the <i>eutBC</i> genes encoding ethanolamine ammonia-lyase (EAL) is increased. A strain with an IS<i>Aba1</i> element upstream of the <i>eutBC</i> genes efficiently used EA as a carbon and energy source. The A. baumannii EAL (<i>Ab</i>EAL) enzyme supported the growth of a strain of Salmonella lacking the entire <i>eut</i> operon. Remarkably, the growth of the above-mentioned Salmonella strain did not require the metabolosome, the reactivase EutA enzyme, the EutE acetaldehyde dehydrogenase, or the addition of glutathione to the medium. Transmission electron micrographs showed that when Acinetobacter baumannii or Salmonella enterica subsp. <i>enterica</i> serovar Typhimurium strain LT2 synthesized <i>Ab</i>EAL, the protein localized to the cell membrane. We also report that the A. baumannii genome encodes all of the enzymes needed for the assembly of the nucleotide loop of cobamides and that it uses these enzymes to synthesize different cobamides from the precursor cobinamide and several nucleobases. In the absence of exogenous nucleobases, the most abundant cobamide produced by A. baumannii was cobalamin. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Acinetobacter baumannii is a Gram-negative bacterium commonly found in soil and water. A. baumannii is an opportunistic human pathogen, considered by the CDC to be a serious threat to human health due to the multidrug resistance commonly associated with this bacterium. Knowledge of the metabolic capabilities of A. baumannii is limited. The importance of the work reported here lies in the identification of ethanolamine catabolism occurring in the absence of a metabolosome structure. In other bacteria, this structure protects the cell against damage by acetaldehyde generated by the deamination of ethanolamine. In addition, the ethanolamine ammonia-lyase (EAL) enzyme of this bacterium is unique in that it does not require a reactivase enzyme to remain active. Importantly, we also demonstrate that the A. baumannii genome encodes the functions needed to assemble adenosylcobamide, the coenzyme of EAL, from the precursor cobinamide.	2022 Aug	Elizabeth A Villa, Jorge C Escalante-Semerena	mBio
35899254	Co-evolutionary adaptations of <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> and a clinical carbapenemase-encoding plasmid during carbapenem exposure.	OXA-23 is the predominant carbapenemase in carbapenem-resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>. The co-evolutionary dynamics of <i>A. baumannii</i> and OXA-23-encoding plasmids are poorly understood. Here, we transformed <i>A. baumannii</i> ATCC 17978 with pAZJ221, a <i>bla</i> <sub>OXA-23</sub>-containing plasmid from clinical <i>A. baumannii</i> isolate A221, and subjected the transformant to experimental evolution in the presence of a sub-inhibitory concentration of imipenem for nearly 400 generations. We used population sequencing to track genetic changes at six time points and evaluated phenotypic changes. Increased fitness of evolving populations, temporary duplication of <i>bla</i> <sub>OXA-23</sub> in pAZJ221, interfering allele dynamics, and chromosomal locus-level parallelism were observed. To characterize genotype-to-phenotype associations, we focused on six mutations in parallel targets predicted to affect small RNAs and a cyclic dimeric (3' → 5') GMP-metabolizing protein. Six isogenic mutants with or without pAZJ221 were engineered to test for the effects of these mutations on fitness costs and plasmid kinetics, and the evolved plasmid containing two copies of <i>bla</i> <sub>OXA-23</sub> was transferred to ancestral ATCC 17978. Five of the six mutations contributed to improved fitness in the presence of pAZJ221 under imipenem pressure, and all but one of them impaired plasmid conjugation ability. The duplication of <i>bla</i> <sub>OXA-23</sub> increased host fitness under carbapenem pressure but imposed a burden on the host in antibiotic-free media relative to the ancestral pAZJ221. Overall, our study provides a framework for the co-evolution of <i>A. baumannii</i> and a clinical <i>bla</i> <sub>OXA-23</sub>-containing plasmid in the presence of imipenem, involving early <i>bla</i> <sub>OXA-23</sub> duplication followed by chromosomal adaptations that improved the fitness of plasmid-carrying cells.	2022 Jul	Linyue Zhang, Ying Fu, Linghong Zhang, Qingye Xu, Yunxing Yang, Jintao He, Sebastian Leptihn, Belinda Loh, Robert A Moran, Willem van Schaik, Mark Alexander Toleman, Qiong Chen, Lilin Liu, Yunsong Yu, Xiaoting Hua	Evol Appl

36618317	Detection of the <i>aadA1</i> and aac (3)-1V resistance genes in <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>.	<i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> is a gram-negative aerobic bacterium that can be found in different environments, such as food, containing vegetables, meat, and fish; moreover, it can be present in soil and freshwater. <i>A. baumannii</i> has globally considered an opportunistic nosocomial bacterium in the healthcare setting contributing to increased morbidity and mortality. The current study aimed to detect the aminoglycoside genes in <i>A. baumannii</i> isolated from different clinical causes. In total, 20 isolates of <i>A. baumannii</i> were obtained from different clinical cases. Bacterial isolate DNA was extracted using a DNA extraction kit. Quantus Fluorometer was used to detect the concentration of the extracted DNA in order to detect the goodness of samples. 1 μl of DNA and 199 μl of diluted QuantiFlour Dye were mixed. After 5 min incubation at room temperature, DNA concentration values were evaluated, and following the initial amplification of the <i>A. baumannii</i> <i>aadA1</i> gene, 20 μl of PCR product with F and R primers were sent to Sanger sequencing. The results of the antimicrobial susceptibility revealed that <i>A. baumannii</i> isolates were resistant to Gentamicin (95%), Amikacin (90%), and Tobramycin (60%). Molecular investigation of the <i>aadA1</i> and <i>aac (3)-IV</i> genes exhibited that the <i>aadA1</i> gene was detected in 15% of the isolates. However, the <i>aac (3)-IV</i> gene was not detected in any of the isolates. The gel electrophoresis revealed that the molecular weight of the <i>aadA1</i> gene was 490bp. The DNA sequence of the <i>aadA1</i> gene was conducted in this study, and the results exhibited no mutations in all isolates.	2022 Jun	E A Hussain, H Qasim Hameed, A Mujahid Al-Shuwaikh, R Mujahid Abdullah	Arch Razi Inst

It is sometimes difficult to distinguish between <i>A. baumannii</i> infection and colonization. This study aimed to evaluate factors that differentiate infection from colonization and predict mortality in patients with nosocomial pneumonia caused by <i>A. baumannii</i>.	2022	Ding-Yun Feng, Jian-Xia Zhou, Xia Li, Wen-Bin Wu, Yu-Qi Zhou, Tian-Tuo Zhang	Infect Drug Resist
33719791	Loss of thermotolerance in antibiotic-resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>.	Bacterium <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> is a leading cause of nosocomial infections. The occurrence of antibiotic-resistant <i>A. baumannii</i> isolates outside hospitals suggests that monitoring of this pathogen in environmental samples is needed. Survival of pandrug-resistant <i>A. baumannii</i> was followed on selective plates with and without carbapenems in water and soil. After a few days of starvation, <i>A. baumannii</i> lost the ability to be cultivated at 44°C on plates supplemented with carbapenems. Once cultivated on plates without carbapenems and/or at 36°C, <i>A. baumannii</i> could grow again at 44°C in the presence of carbapenems. Comparative proteomic analysis revealed that impaired membrane integrity and reduced function of efflux pumps due to elevated temperature combined with antibiotic exposure were the main reasons for this phenomenon. Loss of thermotolerance in the presence of antibiotics points to the need for temperature adjustment in long-term monitoring of <i>A. baumannii</i> in environmental samples, to avoid the underestimation of viable bacteria.	2022 Jul	Svjetlana Dekić Rozman, Ana Butorac, Rea Bertoša, Jasna Hrenović, Marina Markeš	Int J Environ Health Res
35972564	Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Elizabethkingia miricola isolated from wastewater have biodegradable activity against fluoroquinolone.	Ciprofloxacin (CIP) and levofloxacin (LEV), widely used fluoroquinolone antibiotics, are often found in sewage from the sewage treatment plants and marine environment. In this study, CIP and LEV biodegrading bacterial consortia were obtained from industrial wastewater. Microorganisms in these consortia were identified as Acinetobacter baumannii (A. baumannii), Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae) and Elizabethkingia miricola (E. miricola). The impacts of the critical operating parameters on the elimination of CIP and LEV by bacterial consortia have been investigated and optimized to achieve the maximum levels of CIP and LEV biodegradation. Using liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS-MS), possible degradation pathways for CIP and LEV were suggested by analyzing the intermediate degradation products. The role of the enzymes fluoroquinolone-acetylating aminoglycoside (6'-N-acetyltransferase) and cytochrome P450 (CYP450) in the breakdown of fluoroquinolones (FQs) was investigated as well. According to our findings, various biodegradation mechanisms have been suggested, including cleavage of piperazine ring, substitution of F atom, hydroxylation, decarboxylation, and acetylation, as the main biotransformation reactions. This study discovers the ability of non-reported bacterial strains to biodegrade both CIP and LEV as a sole carbon source, providing new insights into the biodegradation of CIP and LEV.	2022 Aug	Reham Alaa Eldin Shaker, Yosra Ibrahim Nagy, Mina E Adly, Rania Abdelmonem Khattab, Yasser M Ragab	World J Microbiol Biotechnol
37162304	Generation of Synthetic <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>-Specific Nanobodies.	The bacterial pathogen <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> is a leading cause of drug-resistant infections. Here, we investigated the potential of developing nanobodies that can recognize <i>A. baumannii</i> over other Gram-negative bacteria. Through generation and panning of a synthetic nanobody library, we identified several potential lead candidates. We demonstrate how incorporation of next-generation sequencing analysis can aid in the selection of lead candidate nanobodies. Using monoclonal phage display, we validated the binding of lead nanobodies to <i>A. baumannii</i>. Subsequent purification and biochemical characterization revealed one particularly robust nanobody that specifically bound select <i>A. baumannii</i> strains compared to other common drug-resistant pathogens. These findings support the potential for nanobodies to selectively target <i>A. baumannii</i> and the identification of lead candidates for future investigation.	2023 May	Gregory A Knauf, Kyra E Groover, Angela C O'Donnell, Bryan W Davies	ACS Infect Dis
36978383	Colistin Resistance in <i>Acinetobacter baumannii:</i> Molecular Mechanisms and Epidemiology.	<i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> is recognized as a clinically significant pathogen causing a wide spectrum of nosocomial infections. Colistin was considered a last-resort antibiotic for the treatment of infections caused by multidrug-resistant <i>A. baumannii</i>. Since the reintroduction of colistin, a number of mechanisms of colistin resistance in <i>A. baumannii</i> have been reported, including complete loss of LPS by inactivation of the biosynthetic pathway, modifications of target LPS driven by the addition of phosphoethanolamine (PEtN) moieties to lipid A mediated by the chromosomal <i>pmrCAB</i> operon and <i>eptA</i> gene-encoded enzymes or plasmid-encoded <i>mcr</i> genes and efflux of colistin from the cell. In addition to resistance to colistin, widespread heteroresistance is another feature of <i>A. baumannii</i> that leads to colistin treatment failure. This review aims to present a critical assessment of relevant published (>50 experimental papers) up-to-date knowledge on the molecular mechanisms of colistin resistance in <i>A. baumannii</i> with a detailed review of implicated mutations and the global distribution of colistin-resistant strains.	2023 Mar	Katarina Novović, Branko Jovčić	Antibiotics (Basel)
35812377	Strain Specific Variations in <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> Complement Sensitivity.	The complement system is required for innate immunity against <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>, an important cause of antibiotic resistant systemic infections. <i>A. baumannii</i> strains differ in their susceptibility to the membrane attack complex (MAC) formed from terminal complement pathway proteins, but the reasons for this variation remain poorly understood. We have characterized in detail the complement sensitivity phenotypes of nine <i>A. baumannii</i> clinical strains and some of the factors that might influence differences between strains. Using <i>A. baumannii</i> laboratory strains and flow cytometry assays, we first reconfirmed that both opsonization with the complement proteins C3b/iC3b and MAC formation were inhibited by the capsule. There were marked differences in C3b/iC3b and MAC binding between the nine clinical <i>A. baumannii</i> strains, but this variation was partially independent of capsule composition or size. Opsonization with C3b/iC3b improved neutrophil phagocytosis of most strains. Importantly, although C3b/iC3b binding and MAC formation on the bacterial surface correlated closely, MAC formation did not correlate with variations between <i>A. baumannii</i> strains in their levels of serum resistance. Genomic analysis identified only limited differences between strains in the distribution of genes required for serum resistance, but RNAseq data identified three complement-resistance genes that were differentially regulated between a MAC resistant and two MAC intermediate resistant strains when cultured in serum. These data demonstrate that clinical <i>A. baumannii</i> strains vary in their sensitivity to different aspects of the complement system, and that the serum resistance phenotype was influenced by factors in addition to the amount of MAC forming on the bacterial surface.	2022	Gathoni Kamuyu, Giuseppe Ercoli, Elisa Ramos-Sevillano, Sam Willcocks, Chidchamai Kewcharoenwong, Pattarachai Kiratisin, Peter W Taylor, Brendan W Wren, Ganjana Lertmemongkolchai, Richard A Stabler, Jeremy S Brown	Front Immunol

36659926	Comparative genomics and molecular epidemiology of colistin-resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>.	This study aimed to investigate the prevalence and resistance mechanisms of colistin-resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> (ColRAB) isolates in Serbia, assess their genetic relatedness to other circulating <i>A. baumannii</i> isolates in the neighbouring European countries, and analyse the global genomic epidemiology of ColRAB isolates. A total of 784 isolates of <i>A. baumannii</i> were recovered from hospitalised patients in Serbia between 2018 and 2021. The antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed using disk diffusion and broth microdilution. All ColRAB isolates were subjected to DNA isolation and whole-genome sequencing (WGS). Overall, 3.94 % (n = 30) isolates were confirmed as ColRAB. Results of mutational and transcriptional analysis of genes associated with colistin resistance indicate the central role of the two-component regulating system, PmrAB, and increased expression of the <i>pmrC</i> gene in ColRAB. Most of the isolates (n = 29, 96.6 %) belonged to international clone II, with the most common sequence type being ST<sup>Pas</sup>2 (n = 23, 76.6 %). Based on the WGS analysis, ColRAB isolates belonging to the same ST isolated in various countries were grouped into the same clusters, indicating the global dissemination of several high-risk clonal lineages. Phylogenomic analysis of ColRAB isolates, together with all previously published <i>A. baumannii</i> genomes from South-Eastern European countries, showed that colistin resistance arose independently in several clonal lineages. Comparative genomic analysis revealed multiple genes with various roles (transcriptional regulation, transmembrane transport, outer membrane assembly, etc.), which might be associated with colistin resistance in <i>A. baumannii</i>. The obtained findings serve as the basis for further studies, contributing to a better understanding of colistin resistance mechanisms in <i>A. baumannii</i>.	2023	Jovana Kabic, Katarina Novovic, Dusan Kekic, Anika Trudic, Natasa Opavski, Ivica Dimkic, Branko Jovcic, Ina Gajic	Comput Struct Biotechnol J
36066263	Iron Acquisition Mechanisms and Their Role in the Virulence of Acinetobacter baumannii.	Iron is an essential element for survival of most organisms. One mechanism of host defense is to tightly chelate iron to several proteins to limit its extracellular availability. This has forced pathogens such as Acinetobacter baumannii to adapt mechanisms for the acquisition and utilization of iron even in iron-limiting conditions. A. baumannii uses a variety of iron acquisition strategies to meet its iron requirements. It can lyse erythrocytes to harvest the heme molecules, use iron-chelating siderophores, and use outer membrane vesicles to acquire iron. Iron acquisition pathways, in general, have been seen to affect many other virulence factors such as cell adherence, cell motility, and biofilm formation. The knowledge gained from research on iron acquisition led to the synthesis of the antibiotic cefiderocol, which uses iron uptake pathways for entry into the cell with some success as a novel cephalosporin. Understanding the mechanisms of iron acquisition of A. baumannii allows for insight into clinical infections and offer potential targets for novel antibiotics or potentiators of current drugs.	2022 Oct	Shoshana Cook-Libin, Ellen M E Sykes, Vanessa Kornelsen, Ayush Kumar	Infect Immun
36356792	Combination of BauA and OmpA elicit immunoprotection against Acinetobacter baumannii in a murine sepsis model.	Acinetobacter baumannii causes severe nosocomial infections and is a difficult-to-treat pathogen due to the development of multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains. Vaccines and antibody therapy represent alternative promising strategies for the control of infections caused by A. baumannii or its MDR strains. OmpA and BauA have been assigned as protective antigens. However, the efficacy of the combination of these antigens is yet to be investigated. In this study, we targeted two critical antigens of A. baumannii (BauA and OmpA) to enhance immunoprotecting against A. baumannii.	2022 Dec	Motahare Tamehri, Iraj Rasooli, Mahdi Pishgahi, Abolfazl Jahangiri, Fatemeh Ramezanalizadeh, Seyedeh Reyhaneh Banisaeed Langroodi	Microb Pathog
36759602	Cross-protection and cross-feeding between Klebsiella pneumoniae and Acinetobacter baumannii promotes their co-existence.	Acinetobacter baumannii and Klebsiella pneumoniae are opportunistic pathogens frequently co-isolated from polymicrobial infections. The infections where these pathogens co-exist can be more severe and recalcitrant to therapy than infections caused by either species alone, however there is a lack of knowledge on their potential synergistic interactions. In this study we characterise the genomes of A. baumannii and K. pneumoniae strains co-isolated from a single human lung infection. We examine various aspects of their interactions through transcriptomic, phenomic and phenotypic assays that form a basis for understanding their effects on antimicrobial resistance and virulence during co-infection. Using co-culturing and analyses of secreted metabolites, we discover the ability of K. pneumoniae to cross-feed A. baumannii by-products of sugar fermentation. Minimum inhibitory concentration testing of mono- and co-cultures reveals the ability for A. baumannii to cross-protect K. pneumoniae against the cephalosporin, cefotaxime. Our study demonstrates distinct syntrophic interactions occur between A. baumannii and K. pneumoniae, helping to elucidate the basis for their co-existence in polymicrobial infections.	2023 Feb	Lucie Semenec, Amy K Cain, Catherine J Dawson, Qi Liu, Hue Dinh, Hannah Lott, Anahit Penesyan, Ram Maharjan, Francesca L Short, Karl A Hassan, Ian T Paulsen	Nat Commun
36358226	Bactericidal and Anti-Biofilm Activity of the FtsZ Inhibitor C109 against <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>.	In the last few years, <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> has ranked as a number one priority due to its Multi Drug Resistant phenotype. The different metabolic states, such as the one adopted when growing as biofilm, help the bacterium to resist a wide variety of compounds, placing the discovery of new molecules able to counteract this pathogen as a topic of utmost importance. In this context, bacterial cell division machinery and the conserved protein FtsZ are considered very interesting cellular targets. The benzothiadiazole compound C109 is able to inhibit bacterial growth and to block FtsZ GTPase and polymerization activities in <i>Burkholderia cenocepacia</i>, <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>, and <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>. In this work, the activity of C109 was tested against a panel of antibiotic sensitive and resistant <i>A. baumannii</i> strains. Its ability to inhibit biofilm formation was explored, together with its activity against the <i>A. baumannii</i> FtsZ purified protein. Our results indicated that C109 has good MIC values against <i>A. baumannii</i> clinical isolates. Moreover, its antibiofilm activity makes it an interesting alternative treatment, effective against diverse metabolic states. Finally, its activity was confirmed against <i>A. baumannii</i> FtsZ.	2022 Nov	Viola Camilla Scoffone, Samuele Irudal, Aseel AbuAlshaar, Aurora Piazza, Gabriele Trespidi, Giulia Barbieri, Vadim Makarov, Roberta Migliavacca, Edda De Rossi, Silvia Buroni	Antibiotics (Basel)

35867473	Polyphosphate Kinase Is Required for the Processes of Virulence and Persistence in Acinetobacter baumannii.	Acinetobacter baumannii, one of the most successful bacteria causing severe nosocomial infection, was identified as a top-priority pathogen by the WHO. Thus, genetic manipulations to clarify the potential targets for fighting A. baumannii resistance and virulence are vital. Polyphosphate (polyP) kinase (PPK) is conserved in nearly all bacteria and is responsible for polyP formation, which is associated with bacterial pathogenicity and antibiotic resistance. In this study, <i>ppk1</i>-deficient (Δ<i>ppk1</i>::Apr), <i>ppk1</i>-complemented (Δ<i>ppk1</i>::Apr/PJL02-<i>ppk1</i>), and wild-type strains of A. baumannii ATCC 17978 were used to determine the influence of PPK1 on A. baumannii virulence and persistence mainly by polyP quantification, surface motility, biofilm formation, and bacterial persistence assays. Our work found that PPK1 is indispensable for polyP formation <i>in vivo</i> and that the motility of the PPK1-deficient strain was significantly impaired due to the lack of a pilus-like structure typically present compared with the complemented and wild-type strains. The deficiency of PPK1 also inhibited the biofilm formation of A. baumannii and decreased bacterial persistence under stimuli of high-concentration ampicillin (Amp) treatment, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> stress, heat shock, and starvation stress. Furthermore, <i>ppk1</i>-deficient bacterium-infected mice showed a significantly reduced bacterial load and a decreased inflammatory response. However, complementation with PPK1 effectively rescued the impaired virulence and persistence of <i>ppk1</i>-deficient A. baumannii. In addition, metabonomic analysis revealed that PPK1 was associated with glycerophospholipid metabolism and fatty acid biosynthesis. Taken together, our results suggest that targeting PPK1 to control A. baumannii pathogenicity and persistence is a feasible strategy to fight this pathogen. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> A. baumannii was identified as a top-priority pathogen by the WHO due to its antibiotic resistance. Meanwhile, the pathogenicity of A. baumannii mediated by several vital virulence factors also cannot be ignored. Here, the role of PPK1 in A. baumannii was also explored. We found that the motility ability and biofilm formation of a PPK1-deficient strain were significantly impaired. Furthermore, PPK1 was essential for its persistence maintenance to resist stimuli of high-concentration Amp treatment, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> stress, heat shock, and starvation stress. Metabonomic analysis revealed that PPK1 was associated with glycerophospholipid metabolism and fatty acid biosynthesis. In addition, <i>ppk1</i>-deficient bacterium-infected mice showed significantly reduced bacterial loads and a decreased inflammatory responses <i>in vivo</i>. Together, our results suggest that PPK1 is vital for A. baumannii pathogenicity and persistence.	2022 Aug	Hongfa Lv, Yonglin Zhou, Baichen Liu, Jian Guan, Peng Zhang, Xuming Deng, Dan Li, Jianfeng Wang	Microbiol Spectr
35787944	Recombinant AcnB, NrdR and RibD of Acinetobacter baumannii and their potential interaction with DNA adenine methyltransferase AamA.	In the last decades Acinetobacter baumannii developed into an increasingly challenging nosocomial pathogen. A. baumannii ATCC 17978 harbors a DNA-(adenine N6)-methyltransferase termed AamA. Previous studies revealed a low specific activity of AamA in vitro despite proven folding, which led us to speculate about possible interaction partners assisting AamA in targeting methylation sites. Here, applying a pulldown assay with subsequent mass spectrometry we identified aconitate hydratase 2 (AcnB) as possible interaction partner. In addition, we considered the putative transcriptional regulator gene nrdR (A1S_0220) and the pyrimidine deaminase/reductase gene ribD (A1S_0221) of A. baumannii strain ATCC 17978 to encode additional potential interaction partners due to their vicinity to the aamA gene (A1S_0222). Proteins were recombinantly produced in the milligram scale, purified to near homogeneity, and interactions with AamA were studied applying blue native gel electrophoreses, electrophoretic mobility shift assay, chemical cross-linking and co-immunoprecipitation. These analyses did not provide evidence of interaction between AamA and purified proteins. Solution structures of RibD, NrdR and AcnB were studied by small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) alone and in combination with AamA. While in the case of RibD and AcnB no evidence of an interaction with AamA was produced, addition of AamA to NrdR resulted in dissociation of long and rod-shaped polymeric NrdR structures, implying a specific but transient interaction. Moreover, we identified a molecular crowding effect possibly impeding the DNA methyltransferase activity in vivo and a sequence-independent DNA binding activity of AamA calling for continued efforts to identify the interaction network of AamA.	2022 Nov	Kristin Weber, Joerg Doellinger, Cy M Jeffries, Gottfried Wilharm	Protein Expr Purif
36261919	Targeting virulence regulation to disarm <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> pathogenesis.	The development of anti-virulence drug therapy against <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> infections would provide an alternative to traditional antibacterial therapy that are increasingly failing. Here, we demonstrate that the OmpR transcriptional regulator plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of diverse <i>A. baumannii</i> clinical strains in multiple murine and <i>G. mellonella</i> invertebrate infection models. We identified OmpR-regulated genes using RNA sequencing and further validated two genes whose expression can be used as robust biomarker to quantify OmpR inhibition in <i>A. baumannii</i>. Moreover, the determination of the structure of the OmpR DNA binding domain of <i>A. baumannii</i> and the development of <i>in vitro</i> protein-DNA binding assays enabled the identification of an OmpR small molecule inhibitor. We conclude that OmpR is a valid and unexplored target to fight <i>A. baumannii</i> infections and we believe that the described platform combining <i>in silico</i> methods, <i>in vitro</i> OmpR inhibitory assays and <i>in vivo G. mellonella</i> surrogate infection model will facilitate future drug discovery programs.	2022 Dec	Vincent Trebosc, Valentina Lucchini, Mohit Narwal, Basil Wicki, Sarah Gartenmann, Birgit Schellhorn, Julian Schill, Marilyne Bourotte, Daniel Frey, Jürgen Grünberg, Andrej Trauner, Livia Ferrari, Antonio Felici, Olivia L Champion, Marc Gitzinger, Sergio Lociuro, Richard A Kammerer, Christian Kemmer, Michel Pieren	Virulence
35569319	Insights into mucoid Acinetobacter baumannii: A review of microbiological characteristics, virulence, and pathogenic mechanisms in a threatening nosocomial pathogen.	Acinetobacter baumannii (A. baumannii) is an opportunistic pathogen and leading cause of health care-associated infections. Several known pathogenic factors, including lipopolysaccharide, capsular polysaccharides, phospholipase, protein secretion systems, two component efflux pumps and biofilm formation, are associated with the bacteria. However, owing to the new biological characteristics rapidly developed under the external stress, the pathogenesis becomes complicated. The formation of mucoid phenotype is a major adaptive defense response for A. baumannii. The mucus is mainly comprised of capsular polysaccharide, which forms a barrier around the bacterial cell wall, and provides protection from environmental pressures and host immune responses. Importantly, mucoid formation has been shown to confer changes in the pathogenicity and pathogenesis of A. baumannii. Thus, this review aims to highlight the biological characteristics, virulence and underlying pathogenic mechanisms of mucoid A. baumannii. We primarily provide profound insight into the structure, function and detecting methods of the mucus in mucoid A. baumannii. Then we mainly illustrate the current studies on mucoid A. baumannii. Finally, the unsolved areas associated with mucoid A. baumannii are summarized. In summary, this review will critically offer a comprehensive understanding of mucoid A. baumannii and provide novel insight into the diagnosis and intervention strategies for the increasingly deadly human pathogen.	2022 Aug	Wulin Shan, Jinsong Kan, Xueqin Cai, Meiling Yin	Microbiol Res
36760499	Non-antibiotic prevention and treatment against <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> infection: Are vaccines and adjuvants effective strategies?	<i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> (<i>A. baumannii</i>) is a Gram-negative opportunistic pathogen widely attached to the surface of medical instruments, making it one of the most common pathogens of nosocomial infection, and often leading to cross-infection and co-infection. Due to the extensive antibiotic and pan-resistance, <i>A. baumannii</i> infection is facing fewer treatment options in the clinic. Therefore, the prevention and treatment of <i>A. baumannii</i> infection have become a tricky global problem. The requirement for research and development of the new strategy is urgent. Now, non-antibiotic treatment strategies are urgently needed. This review describes the research on <i>A. baumannii</i> vaccines and antibacterial adjuvants, discusses the advantages and disadvantages of different candidate vaccines tested <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>, especially subunit protein vaccines, and shows the antibacterial efficacy of adjuvant drugs in monotherapy.	2023	Yue Hu, Xianqin Zhang, Shanshan Deng, Changwu Yue, Xu Jia, Yuhong Lyu	Front Microbiol
35647655	Activity of Omadacycline Alone and in Combination against Carbapenem-Nonsusceptible Acinetobacter baumannii with Varying Minocycline Susceptibility.	Tetracycline-based combinations are increasingly used for serious carbapenem-nonsusceptible Acinetobacter baumannii (CNSAb) infections given their potent <i>in vitro</i> activity, synergism with other agents, and acceptable toxicity profile. Omadacycline is a novel aminomethylcycline with activity against minocycline-resistant pathogens, once daily oral dosing, and favorable pharmacokinetic properties. Given these potential advantages, the <i>in vitro</i> potency and antibacterial activity of omadacycline were evaluated alone and in combination against CNSAb with varying minocycline susceptibility. Broth microdilution testing of 41 CNSAb revealed that omadacycline (MIC<sub>50/90</sub>: 4/8 mg/L) inhibited 68.3% (28/41) of isolates at ≤4 mg/L and its activity was unaffected by minocycline nonsusceptibility (MIC<sub>50/90</sub>: 4/8 mg/L; 74.2% [23/31] inhibited at ≤4 mg/L). Ten (5 minocycline susceptible and 5 nonsusceptible) of the 41 CNSAb isolates were then evaluated in time-kill analyses against omadacycline and comparator agents alone and in dual- and triple-drug combinations at the free maximum concentration of drug in serum (<i>fC</i><sub>max</sub>). Amikacin, meropenem, and polymyxin B alone were each bactericidal against 4 of 10 (40%) isolates while omadacycline and sulbactam were bactericidal against 0 (0%) and 1 (10%), respectively. In dual-drug combinations with omadacycline, synergy was observed against 80% of isolates with sulbactam followed by 30% with amikacin or polymyxin B and 0% with meropenem or rifampin. The triple-drug combination of omadacycline, sulbactam, and polymyxin B achieved synergy against just one additional strain over the omadacycline-sulbactam dual combination but significantly reduced the time to 99.9% kill by more than 6 h (4.6 ± 2.8 h vs. 11.3 ± 5.9 h, <i>P < </i>0.01). These results support the continued investigation into tetracycline-based combinations against CNSAb, particularly those including sulbactam, and suggest that omadacycline may have <i>in vitro</i> advantages over existing tetracycline-derivatives. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Treatment of infections due to Acinetobacter baumannii often involves the use of multiple antibiotics simultaneously as combination therapy, but it is unknown which antibiotics are best used together. Tetracycline agents such as minocycline and tigecycline maintain good activity against A. baumannii and are often used with one or more other agents to achieve better killing of the bacteria. Omadacycline is a new tetracycline that may have a role in the treatment of A. baumannii, but no data are available evaluating its interaction with other commonly used drugs such as polymyxin B and sulbactam. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the antibacterial activity of omadacycline when combined with one or more other agents against carbapenem-resistant strains of A. baumannii. These findings may then be used to design confirmatory studies that could help decide what drugs work best together and what combination of agents should be used for patients.	2022 Jun	Taylor Abbey, Alesia Vialichka, Michele Jurkovic, Mark Biagi, Eric Wenzler	Microbiol Spectr
35867872	3-indoleacetonitrile attenuates biofilm formation and enhances sensitivity to imipenem in Acinetobacter baumannii.	Acinetobacter baumannii poses a global danger due to its ability to resist most of the currently available antimicrobial agents. Furthermore, the rise of carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii isolates has limited the treatment options available. In the present study, plant auxin 3-indoleacetonitrile (3IAN) was found to inhibit biofilm formation and motility of A. baumannii at sublethal concentration. Mechanistically, 3IAN inhibited the synthesis of the quorum sensing signal 3-OH-C12-HSL by downregulating the expression of the abaI autoinducer synthase gene. 3IAN was found to reduce the minimum inhibitory concentration of A. baumannii ATCC 17978 against imipenem, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, tobramycin, and levofloxacin, and significantly decreased persistence against imipenem. Inhibition of efflux pumps by downregulating genes expression may be responsible for enhanced sensitivity and low persistence. 3IAN reduced the resistance to imipenem in carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii isolates by downregulating the expression of OXA β-lactamases (blaoxa-51 and blaoxa-23), outer membrane protein carO, and transporter protein adeB. These findings demonstrate the therapeutic potential of 3IAN, which could be explored as an adjuvant with antibiotics for controlling A. baumannii infections.	2022 Aug	Shruti Kashyap, Harsimran Sidhu, Prince Sharma, Neena Capalash	Pathog Dis
35938813	CRISPR-Cas in Acinetobacter baumannii Contributes to Antibiotic Susceptibility by Targeting Endogenous <i>AbaI</i>.	Acinetobacter baumannii is a well-known human opportunistic pathogen in nosocomial infections, and the emergence of multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii has become a complex problem for clinical anti-infective treatments. The ways this organism obtains multidrug resistance phenotype include horizontal gene transfer and other mechanisms, such as altered targets, decreased permeability, increased enzyme production, overexpression of efflux pumps, metabolic changes, and biofilm formation. A CRISPR-Cas system generally consists of a CRISPR array and one or more operons of <i>cas</i> genes, which can restrict horizontal gene transfer in bacteria. Nevertheless, it is unclear how CRISPR-Cas systems regulate antibiotic resistance in Acinetobacter baumannii. Thus, we sought to assess how CRISPR-Cas affects biofilm formation, membrane permeability, efflux pump, reactive oxygen species, and quorum sensing to clarify further the mechanism of CRISPR-Cas regulation of Acinetobacter baumannii antibiotic resistance. In the clinical isolate AB43, which has a complete I-Fb CRISPR-Cas system, we discovered that the Cas3 nuclease of this type I-F CRISPR-Cas system regulates Acinetobacter baumannii quorum sensing and has a unique function in changing drug resistance. As a result of quorum sensing, synthase <i>abaI</i> is reduced, allowing efflux pumps to decrease, biofilm formation to become weaker, reactive oxygen species to generate, and drug resistance to decrease in response to CRISPR-Cas activity. These observations suggest that the CRISPR-Cas system targeting endogenous <i>abaI</i> may boost bacterial antibiotic sensitivity. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> CRISPR-Cas systems are vital for genome editing, bacterial virulence, and antibiotic resistance. How CRISPR-Cas systems regulate antibiotic resistance in Acinetobacter baumannii is almost wholly unknown. In this study, we reveal that the quorum sensing regulator <i>abaI</i> mRNA was a primary target of the I-Fb CRISPR-Cas system and the cleavage activity of Cas3 was the most critical factor in regulating <i>abaI</i> mRNA degradation. These results advance our understanding of how CRISPR-Cas systems inhibit drug resistance. However, the mechanism of endogenous targeting of <i>abaI</i> by CRISPR-Cas needs to be further explored.	2022 Aug	Yuhang Wang, Jie Yang, Xiaoli Sun, Mengying Li, Pengyu Zhang, Zhongtian Zhu, Hongmei Jiao, Tingting Guo, Guocai Li	Microbiol Spectr
36318583	Differential activation of NLRP3 inflammasome by Acinetobacter baumannii strains.	Acinetobacter baumannii is an emerging nosocomial, opportunistic pathogen with growing clinical significance globally. A. baumannii has an exceptional ability to rapidly develop drug resistance. It is frequently responsible for ventilator-associated pneumonia in clinical settings and inflammation resulting in severe sepsis. The inflammatory response is mediated by host pattern-recognition receptors and the inflammasomes. Inflammasome activation triggers inflammatory responses, including the secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-18, the recruitment of innate immune effectors against A. baumannii infection, and the induction programmed cell death by pyroptosis. An important knowledge gap is how variation among clinical isolates affects the host's innate response and activation of the inflammasome during A. baumannii infection. In this study, we compared nine A. baumannii strains, including clinical locally-acquired isolates, in their ability to induce activation of the inflammasome and programmed cell death in primary macrophages, epithelial lung cell line and mice. We found a variation in survival outcomes of mice and bacterial dissemination in organs among three commercially available A. baumannii strains, likely due to the differences in virulence between strains. Interestingly, we found variability among A. baumannii strains in activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, non-canonical Caspase-11 pathway, plasmatic secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1β and programmed cell death. Our study highlights the importance of utilising multiple bacterial strains and clinical isolates with different virulence to investigate the innate immune response to A. baumannii infection.	2022	Fei-Ju Li, Lora Starrs, Anukriti Mathur, Hikari Ishii, Si Ming Man, Gaetan Burgio	PLoS One
35610334	Acinetobacter baumannii response to cefiderocol challenge in human urine.	Cefiderocol (CFDC) is a novel chlorocatechol-substituted siderophore antibiotic approved to treat complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI) and hospital-acquired and ventilator-acquired pneumonia (HAP/VAP). Previous work determined that albumin-rich human fluids increase the minimum inhibitory concentration (MICs) of Acinetobacter baumannii against CFDC and reduce the expression of genes related to iron uptake systems. This latter effect may contribute to the need for higher concentrations of CFDC to inhibit growth. The presence of human urine (HU), which contains low albumin concentrations, did not modify MIC values of two carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii. Levels of resistance to CFDC were not modified by HU in strain AMA40 but were reduced in strain AB5075. Expanding the studies to other carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii isolates showed that the presence of HU resulted in unmodified or reduced MIC of CDFC values. The expression of piuA, pirA, bauA, and bfnH determined by qRT-PCR was enhanced in A. baumannii AMA40 and AB5075 by the presence of HU in the culture medium. All four tested genes code for functions related to recognition and transport of ferric-siderophore complexes. The effect of HU on expression of pbp1, pbp3, bla<sub>OXA-51-like</sub>, bla<sub>ADC</sub>, and bla<sub>NDM-1</sub>, genes associated with resistance to β-lactams, as well as genes coding for efflux pumps and porins was variable, showing dependence with the strain analyzed. We conclude that the lack of significant concentrations of albumin and free iron in HU makes this fluid behave differently from others we tested. Unlike other albumin rich fluids, the presence of HU does not impact the antibacterial activity of CFDC when tested against A. baumannii.	2022 May	Brent Nishimura, Jenny Escalante, Marisel R Tuttobene, Tomás Subils, Vyanka Mezcord, Camila Pimentel, Nardin Georgeos, Fernando Pasteran, Cecilia Rodriguez, Rodrigo Sieira, Luis A Actis, Marcelo E Tolmasky, Robert A Bonomo, María Soledad Ramirez	Sci Rep

36290064	Recent Progress in Phage Therapy to Modulate Multidrug-Resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>, including in Human and Poultry.	<i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> is a multidrug-resistant and invasive pathogen associated with the etiopathology of both an increasing number of nosocomial infections and is of relevance to poultry production systems. Multidrug-resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> has been reported in connection to severe challenges to clinical treatment, mostly due to an increased rate of resistance to carbapenems. Amid the possible strategies aiming to reduce the insurgence of antimicrobial resistance, phage therapy has gained particular importance for the treatment of bacterial infections. This review summarizes the different phage-therapy approaches currently in use for multiple-drug resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>, including single phage therapy, phage cocktails, phage-antibiotic combination therapy, phage-derived enzymes active on <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> and some novel technologies based on phage interventions. Although phage therapy represents a potential treatment solution for multidrug-resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>, further research is needed to unravel some unanswered questions, especially in regard to its in vivo applications, before possible routine clinical use.	2022 Oct	Yan Zhang, Yuanqing Lin, Salvatore Galgano, Jos Houdijk, Weiquan Xie, Yajie Jin, Jiameng Lin, Wuqiang Song, Yijuan Fu, Xiuying Li, Wenting Chui, Wei Kan, Cai Jia, Guangwei Hu, Tao Li	Antibiotics (Basel)
36335338	Insight into carbapenem resistance and virulence of Acinetobacter baumannii from a children's medical centre in eastern China.	Carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB) appeared more frequently in children and caused a great threat to global public health. It is urgent to investigate the carbapenem resistance and virulence of CRAB for clinicians to choose appropriate antibiotics. A retrospective study of 77 nonduplicated CRAB isolates was conducted. The carbapenem resistance and virulence genes were characterized by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and gel electrophoresis. In the present study, A. baumannii mainly came from the intensive care unit and was mostly isolated from sputum samples. The carbapenem resistant rate of A. baumannii in 2018-2020 increased significantly compared with that in 2016-2017. All isolates had carbapenem resistant genes. They were highly resistant to a variety of antibiotics but were relatively sensitive to fluoroquinolones and tetracyclines. blaVIM and blaOXA-23 were detected in all isolates, whereas blaOXA-51, blaIMP and blaNDM were present in 98.70%, 67.53% and 31.17% of isolates, respectively. Notably, 1 isolate A. baumannii was identified as multidrug-resistant A. baumannii (MDR-AB), and 76 other extensively drug-resistance (XDR) isolates were also detected. Virulence genes were present in 100% of all isolates, including genes in the iron acquisition system (basJ), secretion systems (ompA, plcD), quorum sensing system (abaI) and biofilm formation (csuA). adeH, pgaA, and ptk were present in 98.70%, 98.70% and 94.80% of isolates, respectively. CRAB, which is prevalent in east China, carries a large number of drug resistance and virulence genes. Fluoroquinolones and tetracyclines may be effective antibiotics for the treatment of CRAB infection in children. An in-depth understanding of the resistance and virulence of CRAB is conducive to timely guiding empirical drug use and controlling infection.	2022 Nov	Yunfen Zhu, Xin Zhang, Yunzhong Wang, Yunzhen Tao, Xuejun Shao, Yang Li, Wei Li	Ann Clin Microbiol Antimicrob
35950629	Semi-Synthetic Glycoconjugate Vaccine Lead Against Acinetobacter baumannii 17978.	Acinetobacter baumannii is a opportunistic bacterial pathogen responsible for serious nosocomial infections that is becoming increasingly resistant against antibiotics. Capsular polysaccharides (CPS) that cover A. baumannii are a major virulence factor that play an important role in pathogenesis, are used to assign serotypes and provide the basis for vaccine development. Synthetic oligosaccharides resembling the CPS of A. baumannii 17978 were printed onto microarray slides and used to screen sera from patients infected with A. baumannii as well as a monoclonal mouse antibody (mAb C8). A synthetic oligosaccharide emerged from glycan array screening as lead for the development of a vaccine against A. baumannii 17978. Tetrasaccharide 20 is a key epitope for recognition by an antibody and is a vaccine lead.	2022 Oct	Julinton Sianturi, Patricia Priegue, Jing Hu, Jian Yin, Peter H Seeberger	Angew Chem Int Ed Engl
35760825	A unique antigen against SARS-CoV-2, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.	The recent outbreak of COVID-19 has increased hospital admissions, which could elevate the risk of nosocomial infections, such as A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa infections. Although effective vaccines have been developed against SARS-CoV-2, no approved treatment option is still available against antimicrobial-resistant strains of A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa. In the current study, an all-in-one antigen was designed based on an innovative, state-of-the-art strategy. In this regard, experimentally validated linear epitopes of spike protein (SARS-CoV-2), OmpA (A. baumannii), and OprF (P. aeruginosa) were selected to be harbored by mature OmpA as a scaffold. The selected epitopes were used to replace the loops and turns of the barrel domain in OmpA; OprF<sub>311-341</sub> replaced the most similar sequence within the OmpA, and three validated epitopes of OmpA were retained intact. The obtained antigen encompasses five antigenic peptides of spike protein, which are involved in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenicity. One of these epitopes, viz. QTQTNSPRRARSV could trigger antibodies preventing super-antigenic characteristics of spike and alleviating probable autoimmune responses. The designed antigen could raise antibodies neutralizing emerging variants of SARS-CoV-2 since at least two epitopes are consensus. In conclusion, the designed antigen is expected to raise protective antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, A. baumannii, and P. aeruginosa.	2022 Jun	Mohammad Reza Rahbar, Shaden M H Mubarak, Anahita Hessami, Bahman Khalesi, Navid Pourzardosht, Saeed Khalili, Kobra Ahmadi Zanoos, Abolfazl Jahangiri	Sci Rep
37090073	Drug‑resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>: From molecular mechanisms to potential therapeutics (Review).	Bacterial drug resistance is increasingly becoming an important problem that needs to be solved urgently in modern clinical practices. Infection caused by <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> is a serious threat to the life and health of patients. The drug resistance rate of <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> strains is increasing, thus research on the drug resistance of <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> has also seen an increase. When patients are infected with drug-resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>, the availability of suitable antibiotics commonly used in clinical practices is becoming increasingly limited and the prognosis of patients is worsening. Studying the molecular mechanism of the drug resistance of <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> is fundamental to solving the problem of drug-resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> and potentially other 'super bacteria'. Drug resistance mechanisms primarily include enzymes, membrane proteins, efflux pumps and beneficial mutations. Research on the underlying mechanisms provides a theoretical basis for the use and development of antibiotics and the development of novel treatment methods.	2023 May	Hao-Jia Wu, Zhi-Gang Xiao, Xiao-Juan Lv, Hai-Tang Huang, Chu Liao, Chen-Yang Hui, Yue Xu, Heng-Fei Li	Exp Ther Med

36191190	Elongation factor P modulates <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> physiology and virulence as a cyclic dimeric guanosine monophosphate effector.	Cyclic diguanosine monophosphate (c-di-GMP) is widely used by bacteria to control biological functions in response to diverse signals or cues. A previous study showed that potential c-di-GMP metabolic enzymes play a role in the regulation of biofilm formation and motility in <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>. However, it was unclear whether and how <i>A. baumannii</i> cells use c-di-GMP signaling to modulate biological functions. Here, we report that c-di-GMP is an important intracellular signal in the modulation of biofilm formation, motility, and virulence in <i>A. baumannii</i>. The intracellular level of c-di-GMP is principally controlled by the diguanylate cyclases (DGCs) A1S_1695, A1S_2506, and A1S_3296 and the phosphodiesterase (PDE) A1S_1254. Intriguingly, we revealed that A1S_2419 (an elongation factor P [EF-P]), is a novel c-di-GMP effector in <i>A. baumannii</i>. Response to a c-di-GMP signal boosted A1S_2419 activity to rescue ribosomes from stalling during synthesis of proteins containing consecutive prolines and thus regulate <i>A. baumannii</i> physiology and pathogenesis. Our study presents a unique and widely conserved effector that controls bacterial physiology and virulence by sensing the second messenger c-di-GMP.	2022 Oct	Quan Guo, Binbin Cui, Mingfang Wang, Xia Li, Huihui Tan, Shihao Song, Jianuan Zhou, Lian-Hui Zhang, Yinyue Deng	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A
35743328	Durlobactam in the Treatment of Multidrug-Resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> Infections: A Systematic Review.	<i>A. baumannii</i> is a frequent cause of difficult-to-treat healthcare-associated infections. The use of a novel beta-lactamase inhibitor, durlobactam, has been proposed against multidrug-resistant <i>A. baumannii</i>. A systematic review of studies assessing the efficacy and safety of durlobactam in the treatment of multidrug-resistant <i>A. baumannii</i> infections was carried out. The study protocol was pre-registered on PROSPERO (CRD42022311723). Published articles on durlobactam were identified through computerized literature searches with the search terms "durlobactam" and "ETX2514" using PubMed. PubMed was searched until 15 February 2022. Articles providing data on the main characteristics of durlobactam and on the efficacy and safety of durlobactam in the treatment of <i>A. baumannii</i> infections were included in this systematic review. Attempt was made to obtain information about unpublished studies. English language restriction was applied. The risk of bias in the included studies was not assessed. Both quantitative and qualitative information were summarized by means of textual descriptions. Thirty studies on durlobactam were identified, published from June 2017 to November 2020. Sixteen studies met the inclusion criteria. Durlobactam is effective against <i>A. baumannii</i> when used in combination with sulbactam. Future clinical trials are needed to confirm the possibility to treat infections caused by multidrug-resistant <i>A. baumannii</i> with this combination.	2022 Jun	Guido Granata, Fabrizio Taglietti, Francesco Schiavone, Nicola Petrosillo	J Clin Med
35978016	Socioeconomic burden of pneumonia due to multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in Korea.	We aimed to estimate the socioeconomic burden of pneumonia due to multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (MRAB) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MRPA). We prospectively searched for MRAB and MRPA pneumonia cases and matched them with susceptible-organism pneumonia and non-infected patients from 10 hospitals. The matching criteria were: same principal diagnosis, same surgery or intervention during hospitalisation, age, sex, and admission date within 60 days. We calculated the economic burden by using the difference in hospital costs, the difference in caregiver costs, and the sum of productivity loss from an unexpected death. We identified 108 MRAB pneumonia [MRAB-P] and 28 MRPA pneumonia [MRPA-P] cases. The estimated number of annual MRAB-P and MRPA-P cases in South Korea were 1309-2483 and 339-644, with 485-920 and 133-253 deaths, respectively. The annual socioeconomic burden of MRAB-P and MRPA-P in South Korea was $64,549,723-122,533,585 and $15,241,883-28,994,008, respectively. The results revealed that MRAB-P and MRPA-P occurred in 1648-3127 patients, resulted in 618-1173 deaths, and caused a nationwide socioeconomic burden of $79,791,606-151,527,593. Multidrug-resistant organisms (MDRO) impose a great clinical and economic burden at a national level. Therefore, controlling the spread of MDRO will be an effective measure to reduce this burden.	2022 Aug	Chung-Jong Kim, Kyoung-Ho Song, Nam-Kyong Choi, Jeonghoon Ahn, Ji Yun Bae, Hee Jung Choi, Younghee Jung, Seung Soon Lee, Ji-Hwan Bang, Eu Suk Kim, Song Mi Moon, Je Eun Song, Yee Gyung Kwak, Shin Hye Chun, Yeon-Sook Kim, Kyung-Hwa Park, Yu Min Kang, Pyoeng Gyun Choe, Shinwon Lee, Hong Bin Kim, Korea INfectious Diseases (KIND) Study Group	Sci Rep
36423170	Isolation and Characterization of a <i>Phapecoctavirus</i> Infecting Multidrug-Resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> in A549 Alveolar Epithelial Cells.	Multidrug-resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> (MDR <i>A. baumannii</i>) is an emerging pathogen in the ESKAPE group. The global burden of antimicrobial resistance has led to renewed interest in alternative antimicrobial treatment strategies, including phage therapy. This study isolated and characterized a phage vB_AbaM_ ABPW7 (vABPW7) specific to MDR <i>A. baumannii</i>. Morphological analysis showed that phage vABPW7 belongs to the <i>Myoviridae</i> family. Genome analysis showed that the phage DNA genome consists of 148,647 bp and that the phage is a member of the <i>Phapecoctavirus</i> genus of the order <i>Caudovirales.</i> A short latent period and a large burst size indicated that phage vABPW7 was a lytic phage that could potentially be used in phage therapy. Phage vABPW7 is a high-stability phage that has high lytic activity. Phage vABPW7 could effectively reduce biofilm formation and remove preformed biofilm. The utility of phage vABPW7 was investigated in a human A549 alveolar epithelial cell culture model. Phage vABPW7 was not cytotoxic to A549 cells, and the phage could significantly reduce planktonic MDR <i>A. baumannii</i> and MDR <i>A. baumannii</i> adhesion on A549 cells without cytotoxicity. This study suggests that phage vABPW7 has the potential to be developed further as a new antimicrobial agent against MDR <i>A. baumannii</i>.	2022 Nov	Phitchayapak Wintachai, Komwit Surachat, Ganyalak Chaimaha, Abdi Wira Septama, Duncan R Smith	Viruses

36293461	Role of EmaSR in Ethanol Metabolism by <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>.	<i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> is a well-known nosocomial pathogen that can survive in different environments through the use of intricate networks to regulate gene expression. Two-component systems (TCS) form an important part of such regulatory networks, and in this study, we describe the identification and characterization of a novel EmaSR TCS in <i>A. baumannii</i>. We constructed a Tn<i>5</i>-tagged mutagenesis library, from which an <i>emaS</i> sensor kinase gene and <i>emaR</i> response regulator gene were identified. We found that <i>emaS</i>/<i>emaR</i> single-mutants and double-mutants were unable to replicate in M9 medium with 1% ethanol as the single carbon source. Motility and biofilm formation were negatively affected in double-mutants, and transcriptomic analysis showed that mutation of <i>emaSR</i> dysregulated genes required for carbon metabolism. In addition, <i>emaS</i>/<i>emaR</i> single-mutants and double-mutants were unable to survive in acetic acid- and sodium acetate-containing medium, indicating that the EmaSR TCS is also important for acetate metabolism. Furthermore, virulence against <i>Galleria mellonella</i> was diminished in <i>emaS</i>/<i>emaR</i> single- and double-mutants. Taken together, these results show that this novel EmaSR TCS is involved in the regulation of <i>A. baumannii</i> ethanol metabolism and acetate metabolism, with important implications on motility, biofilm formation, and virulence if mutated. Further research on the underlying mechanisms is warranted.	2022 Oct	Hung-Yu Shu, Yu-Wen Huang, Ping-Yi Tsai, Kun-Sheng Hsieh, Guang-Huey Lin	Int J Mol Sci
35883478	Identification and Characterization of an RRM-Containing, RNA Binding Protein in <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>.	<i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> is a Gram-negative pathogen, known to acquire resistance to antibiotics used in the clinic. The RNA-binding proteome of this bacterium is poorly characterized, in particular for what concerns the proteins containing RNA Recognition Motif (RRM). Here, we browsed the <i>A. baumannii</i> proteome for homologous proteins to the human HuR(ELAVL1), an RNA binding protein containing three RRMs. We identified a unique locus that we called <i>AB</i>-<i>Elavl</i>, coding for a protein with a single RRM with an average of 34% identity to the first HuR RRM. We also widen the research to the genomes of all the bacteria, finding 227 entries in 12 bacterial phyla. Notably we observed a partial evolutionary divergence between the RNP1 and RNP2 conserved regions present in the prokaryotes in comparison to the metazoan consensus sequence. We checked the expression at the transcript and protein level, cloned the gene and expressed the recombinant protein. The X-ray and NMR structural characterization of the recombinant AB-Elavl revealed that the protein maintained the typical β<sub>1</sub>α<sub>1</sub>β<sub>2</sub>β<sub>3</sub>α<sub>2</sub>β<sub>4</sub> and three-dimensional organization of eukaryotic RRMs. The biochemical analyses showed that, although the RNP1 and RNP2 show differences, it can bind to AU-rich regions like the human HuR, but with less specificity and lower affinity. Therefore, we identified an RRM-containing RNA-binding protein actually expressed in <i>A. baumannii</i>.	2022 Jun	Caterina Ciani, Anna Pérez-Ràfols, Isabelle Bonomo, Mariachiara Micaelli, Alfonso Esposito, Chiara Zucal, Romina Belli, Vito Giuseppe D'Agostino, Irene Bianconi, Vito Calderone, Linda Cerofolini, Orietta Massidda, Michael Bernard Whalen, Marco Fragai, Alessandro Provenzani	Biomolecules
36475894	Phenotypic Characterization and Heterogeneity among Modern Clinical Isolates of Acinetobacter baumannii.	Acinetobacter baumannii is an opportunistic pathogenic bacterium prioritized by WHO and CDC because of its increasing antibiotic resistance. Heterogeneity among strains represents the hallmark of A. baumannii bacteria. We wondered to what extent extensively used strains, so-called reference strains, reflect the dynamic nature and intrinsic heterogeneity of these bacteria. We analyzed multiple phenotypic traits of 43 nonredundant, modern, and multidrug-resistant, extensively drug-resistant, and pandrug-resistant clinical isolates and broadly used strains of A. baumannii. Comparison of these isolates at the genetic and phenotypic levels confirmed a high degree of heterogeneity. Importantly, we observed that a significant portion of modern clinical isolates strongly differs from several historically established strains in the light of colony morphology, cellular density, capsule production, natural transformability, and <i>in vivo</i> virulence. The significant differences between modern clinical isolates of A. baumannii and established strains could hamper the study of A. baumannii, especially concerning its virulence and resistance mechanisms. Hence, we propose a variable collection of modern clinical isolates that are characterized at the genetic and phenotypic levels, covering a wide range of the phenotypic spectrum, with six different macrocolony type groups, from avirulent to hypervirulent phenotypes, and with naturally noncapsulated to hypermucoid strains, with intermediate phenotypes as well. Strain-specific mechanistic observations remain interesting <i>per se</i>, and established "reference" strains have undoubtedly been shown to be very useful to study basic mechanisms of A. baumannii biology. However, any study based on a specific strain of A. baumannii should be compared to modern and clinically relevant isolates. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Acinetobacter baumannii is a bacterium prioritized by the CDC and WHO because of its increasing antibiotic resistance, leading to treatment failures. The hallmark of this pathogen is the high heterogeneity observed among isolates, due to a very dynamic genome. In this context, we tested if a subset of broadly used isolates, considered "reference" strains, was reflecting the genetic and phenotypic diversity found among currently circulating clinical isolates. We observed that the so-called reference strains do not cover the whole diversity of the modern clinical isolates. While formerly established strains successfully generated a strong base of knowledge in the A. baumannii field and beyond, our study shows that a rational choice of strain, related to a specific biological question, should be taken into consideration. Any data obtained with historically established strains should also be compared to modern and clinically relevant isolates, especially concerning drug screening, resistance, and virulence contexts.	2023 Feb	Adam Valcek, Chantal Philippe, Clémence Whiteway, Etienne Robino, Kristina Nesporova, Mona Bové, Tom Coenye, Tim De Pooter, Wouter De Coster, Mojca Strazisar, Charles Van der Henst	Microbiol Spectr

36015076	Novel Antimicrobial Peptide "Octoprohibitin" against Multidrug Resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>.	Octoprohibitin is a synthetic antimicrobial peptide (AMP), derived from the prohibitin-2 gene of <i>Octopus minor</i>. It showed substantial activity against multidrug resistant (MDR) <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of 200 and 400 µg/mL, respectively. Time-kill kinetics and bacterial viability assays confirmed the concentration-dependent antibacterial activity of octoprohibitin against <i>A. baumannii</i>. The morphology and ultrastructure of <i>A. baumannii</i> were altered by treatment with octoprohibitin at the MIC and MBC levels. Furthermore, propidium iodide-fluorescein diacetate (PI-FDA) staining and 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (H<sub>2</sub>DCFDA) staining of octoprohibitin-treated <i>A. baumannii</i> revealed membrane permeability alterations and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, respectively. Agarose gel retardation results confirmed the DNA-binding ability of octoprohibitin to the genomic DNA of <i>A. baumannii</i>. Furthermore, octoprohibitin showed concentration-dependent inhibition of biofilm formation and eradication. The minimum biofilm inhibition concentration (MBIC) and minimum biofilm eradication concentration (MBEC) of octoprohibitin were 1000 and 1460 µg/mL, respectively. Octoprohibitin produced no significant cytotoxicity up to 800 µg/mL, and no hemolysis was observed up to 400 µg/mL. Furthermore, in vivo analysis in an <i>A. baumannii</i>-infected zebrafish model confirmed the effective bactericidal activity of octoprohibitin with higher cumulative survival percent (46.6%) and fewer pathological signs. Histological analysis showed reduced alterations in the gut, kidney, and gill tissues in the octoprohibitin-treated group compared with those in the phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)-treated group.

Many Gram-negative bacteria do not lyse but instead exhibit "tolerance," the ability to sustain viability in the presence of bactericidal antibiotics for extended periods. Antibiotic tolerance has been implicated in treatment failure and is a stepping-stone in the acquisition of true resistance, and the molecular factors that promote intrinsic tolerance are not well understood. Acinetobacter baumannii is a critical-threat nosocomial pathogen notorious for its ability to rapidly develop multidrug resistance. Carbapenem β-lactam antibiotics (i.e., meropenem) are first-line prescriptions to treat A. baumannii infections, but treatment failure is increasingly prevalent. Meropenem tolerance in Gram-negative pathogens is characterized by morphologically distinct populations of spheroplasts, but the impact of spheroplast formation is not fully understood. Here, we show that susceptible A. baumannii clinical isolates demonstrate tolerance to high-level meropenem treatment, form spheroplasts upon exposure to the antibiotic, and revert to normal growth after antibiotic removal. Using transcriptomics and genetic screens, we show that several genes associated with outer membrane integrity maintenance and efflux promote tolerance, likely by limiting entry into the periplasm. Genes associated with peptidoglycan homeostasis in the periplasm and cytoplasm also answered our screen, and their disruption compromised cell envelope barrier function. Finally, we defined the enzymatic activity of the tolerance determinants penicillin-binding protein 7 (PBP7) and ElsL (a cytoplasmic ld-carboxypeptidase). These data show that outer membrane integrity and peptidoglycan recycling are tightly linked in their contribution to A. baumannii meropenem tolerance. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Carbapenem treatment failure associated with "superbug" infections has rapidly increased in prevalence, highlighting the urgent need to develop new therapeutic strategies. Antibiotic tolerance can directly lead to treatment failure but has also been shown to promote the acquisition of true resistance within a population. While some studies have addressed mechanisms that promote tolerance, factors that underlie Gram-negative bacterial survival during carbapenem treatment are not well understood. Here, we characterized the role of peptidoglycan recycling in outer membrane integrity maintenance and meropenem tolerance in A. baumannii. These studies suggest that the pathogen limits antibiotic concentrations in the periplasm and highlight physiological processes that could be targeted to improve antimicrobial treatment.	2022 Jun	Nowrosh Islam, Misha I Kazi, Katie N Kang, Jacob Biboy, Joe Gray, Feroz Ahmed, Richard D Schargel, Cara C Boutte, Tobias Dörr, Waldemar Vollmer, Joseph M Boll	mBio

35890253	Safety and Prophylactic Efficacy of Liposome-Based Vaccine against the Drug-Resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> in Mice.	In recent years, the emergence of multidrug-resistant <i>Acientobacter baumannii</i> has greatly threatened public health and depleted our currently available antibacterial armory. Due to limited therapeutic options, the development of an effective vaccine formulation becomes critical in order to fight this drug-resistant pathogen. The objective of the present study was to develop a safe vaccine formulation that can be effective against <i>A. baumannii</i> infection and its associated complications. Here, we prepared liposomes-encapsulated whole cell antigens (Lip-WCAgs) as a vaccine formulation and investigated its prophylactic efficacy against the systemic infection of <i>A. baumannii</i>. The immunization with Lip-WCAgs induced the higher production of antigen-specific antibody titers, greater lymphocyte proliferation, and increased secretion of Th1 cytokines, particularly IFN-γ and IL-12. Antisera from Lip-WCAgs-immunized mice showed the utmost bactericidal activity and potently inhibited the biofilm formation by <i>A. baumannii</i>. Interestingly, Lip-WCAgs-induced immune response was translated in in vivo protection studies as the immunized mice exhibited the highest resistance to <i>A. baumannii</i> infection. Mice in the group immunized with Lip-WCAgs had an 80% survival rate and a bacterial burden of 5464 ± 1193 CFUs per gram of the lung tissue, whereas the mice immunized with IFA-WCAgs had a 50% survival rate and 51,521 ± 8066 CFUs. In addition, Lip-WCAgs vaccinated mice had lower levels of the inflammatory markers, including CRP, IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α. The findings of this study suggest that Lip-WCAgs may be considered a potential vaccine formulation to protect individuals against <i>A. baumannii</i> infection.	2022 Jun	Masood Alam Khan, Khaled S Allemailem, Hamzah Maswadeh, Hina Younus	Pharmaceutics
35403751	Acinetobacter baumannii: insights towards a comprehensive approach for the prevention of outbreaks in health-care facilities.	Acinetobacter baumannii is known to be an opportunistic pathogen frequently responsible for outbreaks in health-care facilities, particularly in Intensive Care Units (ICU). It can easily survive in the hospital setting for long periods and can be transmitted throughout the hospital in a variety of ways, explored in this review. It can also easily acquire antibiotic resistance determinants rendering several antibiotic drugs useless. In 2019, the US Centre for Disease Control (CDC) considered the organism as an urgent threat. The aim of this review was to raise the awareness of the medical community about the relevance of this pathogen and discuss how it may impact seriously the healthcare institutions particularly in the aftermath of the recent COVID-19 pandemic. PubMed was searched, and articles that met inclusion criteria were reviewed. We conclude by the need to raise awareness to this pathogen's relevance and to encourage the implementation of preventive measures in order to mitigate its consequences namely the triage of specific high-risk patients.	2022 Jun	Diogo Filipe Borges Duarte, Acácio Gonçalves Rodrigues	APMIS
36417919	Acinetobacter baumannii among Patients Receiving Glucocorticoid Aerosol Therapy during Invasive Mechanical Ventilation, China.	Acinetobacter baumannii is a nosocomial pathogen associated with severe illness and death. Glucocorticoid aerosol is a common inhalation therapy in patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation. We conducted a prospective cohort study to analyze the association between glucocorticoid aerosol therapy and A. baumannii isolation from ventilator patients in China. Of 497 enrolled patients, 262 (52.7%) received glucocorticoid aerosol, and A. baumannii was isolated from 159 (32.0%). Glucocorticoid aerosol therapy was an independent risk factor for A. baumannii isolation (hazard ratio 1.5, 95% CI 1.02-2.28; p = 0.038). Patients receiving glucocorticoid aerosol had a higher cumulative hazard for A. baumannii isolation and analysis showed that glucocorticoid aerosol therapy increased A. baumannii isolation in most subpopulations. Glucocorticoid aerosol was not a direct risk factor for 30-day mortality, but A. baumannii isolation was independently associated with 30-day mortality in ventilator patients. Physicians should consider potential A. baumannii infection when prescribing glucocorticoid aerosol therapy.	2022 Dec	Wenchao Zhang, Mei Yin, Wei Li, Nana Xu, Haining Lu, Weidong Qin, Hui Han, Chen Li, Dawei Wu, Hao Wang	Emerg Infect Dis
36992448	Characterization of Virulent T4-Like <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> Bacteriophages DLP1 and DLP2.	The world is currently facing a global health crisis due to the rapid increase in antimicrobial-resistant bacterial infections. One of the most concerning pathogens is <i>Acinetobacter baumannii,</i> which is listed as a Priority 1 pathogen by the World Health Organization. This Gram-negative bacterium has many intrinsic antibiotic resistance mechanisms and the ability to quickly acquire new resistance determinants from its environment. A limited number of effective antibiotics against this pathogen complicates the treatment of <i>A. baumannii</i> infections. A potential treatment option that is rapidly gaining interest is "phage therapy", or the clinical application of bacteriophages to selectively kill bacteria. The myoviruses DLP1 and DLP2 (vB_AbaM-DLP_1 and vB_AbaM-DLP_2, respectively) were isolated from sewage samples using a capsule minus variant of <i>A. baumannii</i> strain AB5075. Host range analysis of these phages against 107 <i>A. baumannii</i> strains shows a limited host range, infecting 15 and 21 for phages DLP1 and DLP2, respectively. Phage DLP1 has a large burst size of 239 PFU/cell, a latency period of 20 min, and virulence index of 0.93. In contrast, DLP2 has a smaller burst size of 24 PFU/cell, a latency period of 20 min, and virulence index of 0.86. Both phages show potential for use as therapeutics to combat <i>A. baumannii</i> infections.	2023 Mar	Danielle L Peters, Carly M Davis, Greg Harris, Hongyan Zhou, Philip N Rather, Sabahudin Hrapovic, Edmond Lam, Jonathan J Dennis, Wangxue Chen	Viruses
36891157	Phenotypic and genomic comparison of dominant and nondominant sequence-type of <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> isolated in China.	<i>A. baumannii</i> is a common clinical pathogen that often causes pneumonia and bloodstream infections in ICU patients. Sequence types (ST) are used to investigate the distribution and spread of <i>A. baumannii</i>. Biological characteristics such as virulence and resistance may play a role in <i>A. baumannii</i> becoming a specific dominant ST(DST,ST191, ST195 and ST208) strain. To characterize the biological, genetic, and transcriptomic differences between the DST and non-dominant ST(NST,ST462 and ST547,etc.) strains in <i>A. baumannii</i>, we performed several biological experiments and genetic, and transcriptomic analyses. The DST group displayed more resistance ability to desiccation, oxidation, multiple antibiotics, and complement killing than the NST group. However, the latter had higher biofilm formation ability than the former. The genomic analysis showed the DST group exhibited more capsule-related and aminoglycoside-resistant genes. Besides, GO analysis indicated that functions involved in lipid biosynthetic, transport, and the metabolic process were up-regulated in the DST group, while KEGG analysis manifested that the two-component system related to potassium ion transport and pili were down-regulated. In short, resistance to desiccation, oxidation, multiple antibiotics, and serum complement killing are important reasons for the formation of DST. Genes related to capsule synthesis and lipid biosynthesis and metabolism play an important role at the molecular level in the formation of DST.	2023	Xiaoyang Kong, Tao Chen, Lihua Guo, Yanzi Zhou, Ping Lu, Yonghong Xiao	Front Cell Infect Microbiol
35884213	Combatting Planktonic and Biofilm Populations of Carbapenem-Resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> with Polymyxin-Based Combinations.	Carbapenem-resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> (CRAB) can cause serious infections that are associated with high mortality rates. During the course of an infection, many CRAB isolates are able to form biofilms, which are recalcitrant to several antibiotics and can be difficult to treat. Polymyxin-based regimens are a first-line treatment option for CRAB infections, but they have not been optimized against both planktonic and biofilm phases of growth. The objective of this study was to identify polymyxin-based combinations that are active against planktonic and biofilm populations of CRAB. Four CRAB isolates (meropenem MICs: 8-256 mg/L) capable of forming biofilms were used in each experiment. The activities of polymyxin B alone and in combination with ampicillin/sulbactam, meropenem, minocycline, and rifampin were assessed using time-kill assays, with the CRAB isolates grown in planktonic and biofilm phases. Viable colony counts were used to detect the bactericidal activity and synergy of the antibiotic combinations. Against the planktonic populations, polymyxin B combined with meropenem, minocycline, ampicillin/sulbactam, and rifampin caused 3.78, -0.15, 4.38, and 3.23 mean log<sub>10</sub> CFU/mL reductions against all isolates at 24 h, respectively. Polymyxin B combined with meropenem, ampicillin/sulbactam, or rifampin was synergistic against 75-100% (3/4 or 4/4) of CRAB isolates. Against biofilms, polymyxin B combined with meropenem, minocycline, ampicillin/sulbactam, and rifampin caused 1.86, 1.01, 0.66, and 3.55 mean log<sub>10</sub> CFU/mL reductions against all isolates at 24 h, respectively. Only the combination of polymyxin B and rifampin retained bactericidal activity or synergy against any of the isolates when grown as biofilms (50% of isolates). The combination of polymyxin B and rifampin may be promising for CRAB infections that have planktonic and biofilm populations present.	2022 Jul	Marisol Wences, Elliot R Wolf, Cindy Li, Nidhi Singh, Nene Bah, Xing Tan, Yanqin Huang, Zackery P Bulman	Antibiotics (Basel)
36451560	Biological and physical characterization of bacteriophage JHA against multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii.	Due to the emergence of antibiotic resistance, bacteriophage therapy appears to be an ideal weapon to utilize against pathogenic bacteria. This study aimed to isolate, identify and characterize the lytic bacteriophage effective against the multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii clinical isolates. The isolated bacteriophage caused lysis by applying the double-layer agar technique on A. baumannii up to 99% in 18 hours of incubation at 37<sup>º</sup>C. The bacterial growth reduction assay exhibited that JHA phage had high adsorption rates and could rapidly inhibit bacterial growth. The pH and thermal stability testing showed that JHA phage was stable in vast ranges of pH from 5 to 9 but its activity was highest at pH7 (1860000±1000 pfu/mL). It was stable in broad ranges of temperatures from 25<sup>º</sup>C to 60<sup>º</sup>C but the highest activity was found at 37<sup>º</sup>C (1300000±30000 pfu/mL). One-step growth test results showed that it has a short latent period, strong lytic ability, high burst size and adsorption rates and was host specific. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of JHA phage demonstrated icosahedral heads and tailless particles. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed JHA phage belongs to Tectiviridae family. All the characteristics of JHA phage possess lytic activity against A. baumannii strains and exhibit novel candidates to use as an alternative competitor to antibiotics in controlling such infections.	2022 Sep	Heba Ajmal, Zubaida Sharif, Basit Zeshan, Nureen Zahra, Madiha Khan	Pak J Pharm Sci
37125466	Global Epidemiology and Mechanisms of Resistance of Acinetobacter baumannii-calcoaceticus Complex.	Acinetobacter baumannii-calcoaceticus complex is the most commonly identified species in the genus Acinetobacter and it accounts for a large percentage of nosocomial infections, including bacteremia, pneumonia, and infections of the skin and urinary tract. A few key clones of A. baumannii-calcoaceticus are currently responsible for the dissemination of these organisms worldwide. Unfortunately, multidrug resistance is a common trait among these clones due to their unrivalled adaptive nature. A. baumannii-calcoaceticus isolates can accumulate resistance traits by a plethora of mechanisms, including horizontal gene transfer, natural transformation, acquisition of mutations, and mobilization of genetic elements that modulate expression of intrinsic and acquired genes.	2023 May	Mariana Castanheira, Rodrigo E Mendes, Ana C Gales	Clin Infect Dis
37219426	Prevalence and Clinical Consequences of Colistin Heteroresistance and Evolution into Full Resistance in Carbapenem-Resistant Acinetobacter baumannii.	Colistin heteroresistance (HR) refers to a bacterial population comprised of several subpopulations with different levels of resistance to colistin. In this study, we discuss the classic form of HR, in which a resistant subpopulation exists within a predominantly susceptible population. We investigated the prevalence of colistin HR and its evolution into full resistance among 173 clinical carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii isolates and examined the effect of HR on clinical outcomes. To determine HR, we performed population analysis profiling. Our results showed a high prevalence of HR (67.1%). To examine evolution of HR strains into full resistance, the HR strains were grown in colistin-containing broth, transferred onto colistin-containing plates, and colonies on these plates were transferred into colistin-free broth. Many of the HR strains (80.2%) evolved into full resistance, 17.2% reverted to HR, and 2.6% were borderline. We used logistic regression to compare 14-day clinical failure and 14-day mortality between patients infected by HR versus susceptible non-HR carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii. In the subgroup of patients with bacteremia, HR was significantly associated with 14-day mortality. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> To our knowledge, this is the first large-scale study to report on HR in Gram-negative bacteria. We described the prevalence of colistin HR in a large sample of carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii isolates, the evolution of many colistin HR isolates to a resistant phenotype following colistin exposure and withdrawal, and the clinical consequences of colistin HR. We found a high prevalence of HR among clinical carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii isolates; most evolved into a resistant phenotype following colistin exposure and withdrawal. In patients treated with colistin, evolution of HR A. baumannii into full resistance could lead to higher rates of treatment failure and contribute to the reservoir of colistin-resistant pathogens in health care settings.	2023 May	Hadas Kon, Amichay Hameir, Amir Nutman, Elizabeth Temkin, Alona Keren Paz, Jonathan Lellouche, David Schwartz, David S Weiss, Keith S Kaye, George L Daikos, Anna Skiada, Emanuele Durante-Mangoni, Yael Dishon Benattar, Dafna Yahav, Vered Daitch, Mariano Bernardo, Domenico Iossa, Lena E Friberg, Ursula Theuretzbacher, Leonard Leibovici, Yaakov Dickstein, Dina Pollak, Sigal Mendelsohn, Mical Paul, Yehuda Carmeli	Microbiol Spectr
35151875	Fighting Acinetobacter baumannii infections with the acylase PvdQ.	Acinetobacter baumannii is an opportunistic Gram-negative bacterial pathogen that poses a threat for frail patients worldwide. The high ability to withstand environmental stresses as well as its resistance towards a broad range of antibiotics make A. baumannii an effective hard-to-eradicate pathogen. One of the key mechanisms mediating tolerance against antibiotic treatment is the formation of biofilms, a process that is controlled by a multitude of different regulatory mechanisms. A key factor with major impact on biofilm formation is cell-to-cell communication by quorum-sensing, which in A. baumannii is mediated by acyl homoserine lactone signaling molecules. Here we show that the Ntn-Hydrolase PvdQ from Pseudomonas aeruginosa can reduce biofilm formation by the A. baumannii ATCC 17978 type strain and several clinical isolates on abiotic surfaces. Further, our study shows that a combination treatment of PvdQ-mediated quorum-quenching with the antibiotic gentamicin has a synergistic effect on the clearance of A. baumannii biofilms and possible biofilm dispersal. Moreover, we demonstrate in a Galleria mellonella larval infection model that PvdQ administration significantly prolongs survival of the larvae. Altogether, we conclude that the acylase-mediated irreversible cleavage of quorum-sensing signaling molecules as exemplified with PvdQ can set a profound limit to the progression of A. baumannii infections.	2022 Jun	Jan Vogel, Lisa Jansen, Rita Setroikromo, Francis M Cavallo, Jan Maarten van Dijl, Wim J Quax	Microbes Infect

35862954	The Cell-Cell Communication Signal Indole Controls the Physiology and Interspecies Communication of Acinetobacter baumannii.	Many bacteria utilize quorum sensing (QS) to control group behavior in a cell density-dependent manner. Previous studies have demonstrated that Acinetobacter baumannii employs an N-acyl-L-homoserine lactone (AHL)-based QS system to control biological functions and virulence. Here, we report that indole controls biological functions, virulence and AHL signal production in A. baumannii. The biosynthesis of indole is performed by A1S_3160 (AbiS, <u>A</u>cinetobacter <u>b</u>aumannii <u>i</u>ndole <u>s</u>ynthase), which is a novel indole synthase annotated as an <i>alpha</i>/<i>beta</i> hydrolase in A. baumannii. Heterologous expression of AbiS in an Escherichia coli indole-deficient mutant also rescued the production of indole by using a distinct biosynthetic pathway from the tryptophanase TnaA, which produces indole directly from tryptophan in E. coli. Moreover, we revealed that indole from A. baumannii reduced the competitive fitness of Pseudomonas aeruginosa by inhibiting its QS systems and type III secretion system (T3SS). As A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa usually coexist in human lungs, our results suggest the crucial roles of indole in both the bacterial physiology and interspecies communication. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Acinetobacter baumannii is an important human opportunistic pathogen that usually causes high morbidity and mortality. It employs the N-acyl-L-homoserine lactone (AHL)-type quorum sensing (QS) system, AbaI/AbaR, to regulate biological functions and virulence. In this study, we found that A. baumannii utilizes another QS signal, indole, to modulate biological functions and virulence. It was further revealed that indole positively controls the production of AHL signals by regulating <i>abaI</i> expression at the transcriptional levels. Furthermore, indole represses the QS systems and type III secretion system (T3SS) of P. aeruginosa and enhances the competitive ability of A. baumannii. Together, our work describes a QS signaling network where a pathogen uses to control the bacterial physiology and pathogenesis, and the competitive ability in microbial community.	2022 Aug	Binbin Cui, Xiayu Chen, Quan Guo, Shihao Song, Mingfang Wang, Jingyun Liu, Yinyue Deng	Microbiol Spectr
36531260	Growth kinetics of multiple <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> resistotype after meropenem-based antibiotic combination exposure.	<b>Background:</b> Carbapenems are the treatment of choice for multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR)  <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> infections, but the emergence of carbapenem-resistant  <i>A. baumannii</i> (CRAB) has rendered it ineffective in the vast majority of cases. Combination therapy has grown in popularity over the last decade; this study aims to analyze  <i>A.baumannii</i> growth kinetics after exposure to meropenem and ampicillin-sulbactam compared with meropenem and amikacin antibiotic combinations in clinically relevant concentrations.  <b>Methods:</b> This experimental laboratory study was conducted on the  <i>A. baumannii</i> ATCC 19606 isolate and three clinical isolates that were intermediate or resistant to tested antibiotics. Meropenem and ampicillin-sulbactam, as well as meropenem and amikacin, were tested at four different concentrations against isolates. Turbidity measurements were taken at predetermined time points of 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 24 hours following exposure; bacterial concentration was enumerated using the agar plate method, with the results plotted in a time-kill curve.   <b>Results:</b> A bactericidal effect was achieved in isolates that were intermediate to ampicillin-sulbactam and resistant to meropenem after the administration of meropenem and ampicillin-sulbactam combination with a concentration of 4 µg/ml and 16/8 µg/ml, respectively. The combination of meropenem and ampicillin-sulbactam demonstrated bacteriostatic activity against isolates that were resistant to both antibiotics. Isolates treated with resistant antibiotics showed an increased growth rate compared to the growth control.  <b>Conclusion:</b> The combination of meropenem and ampicillin-sulbactam could be a promising combination therapy in treating CRAB infections. The mechanism and degree of antibiotic resistance in the isolates affect the efficacy of antibiotic combinations; further research is needed to corroborate the findings of this study.	2022	Erizka Rivani, Pepy Dwi Endraswari, Agung Dwi Wahyu Widodo	F1000Res
36971967	Different Efflux Pump Systems in Acinetobacter baumannii and Their Role in Multidrug Resistance.	Several infections, such as pneumonia, urinary tract infections (UTIs), as well as bloodstream, skin, and soft tissue infections, are caused by Acinetobacter baumannii, a nosocomial pathogen and Gram-negative coccobacillus. Due to its resistance to a variety of medications, multidrug therapy, and occasionally pan therapies, this bacterium is a huge public health concern. Drug resistance is a big worry not only in A. baumannii, but it is also a major challenge in many other diseases. Antibiotic resistance, biofilm development, and genetic alterations are all linked to variables like the efflux pump. Efflux pumps are transport proteins involved in the extrusion of hazardous substrates from within cells into the external environment (including nearly all types of therapeutically relevant antibiotics). Both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, as well as eukaryotic organisms, contain these proteins. Efflux pumps may be specialized for a single substrate or can transport a variety of structurally dissimilar molecules (including antibiotics of many classes); these pumps have been linked to multiple drug resistance (MDR). There are five primary families of efflux transporters in the prokaryotic kingdom: MF (major facilitator), MATE (multidrug and toxic efflux), RND (resistance-nodulation-division), SMR (small multidrug resistance), and ABC (ATP-binding cassette). The efflux pumps and their types as well as the mechanisms of an efflux pump involved in multidrug resistance in bacteria have been discussed here. The main focus is on the variety of efflux pumps commonly found in A. baumannii, along with their mechanism by which they make this bacteria drug resistant. The efflux-pump-inhibitor-based strategies that are significant in targeting efflux pumps in A. baumannii have also been discussed. The connection of biofilm and bacteriophage with the efflux pump can prove as an efficient strategy for targeting efflux-pump-based resistance in A. baumannii.	2023 Mar	Saroj Sharma, Vaishali Kaushik, Mukta Kulshrestha, Vishvanath Tiwari	Adv Exp Med Biol
35367743	BauA and Omp34 surface loops trigger protective antibodies against Acinetobacter baumannii in a murine sepsis model.	The complexity of treating Acinetobacter baumannii infections with the newly developed resistant strains has led researchers to confront this pathogen by developing vaccines. In this study, we used two important virulence factors of A. baumannii to elicit immunity against the A. baumannii. The immunogenic loops were from Baumannii acinetobactin utilization A (BauA) and 34kD outer membrane protein (Omp34). C-lobe derivative of the TbpB surface lipoprotein was used to display the superficial epitopes of the TbpA receptor protein of Neisseria meningitidis. The resulting loopless C-lobe (LCL) with implanted nucleotide sequences of the immunogenic loops from BauA and Omp34 was used as a hybrid antigen. The hybrid antigens were expressed in the E. coli and were used to immunize mice. The mice were challenged with a clinical isolate of A. baumannii (ABI022). Immunization with the hybrid antigens of the BauA loop 7 (BauAL7P3), Omp34 loop 3 Omp34L3P1, and the combination of both loops (BauAL7P3Omp34L3P1) brought about 42.86%, 42.86%, and 71.43% protection against A. baumannii infection. Histopathological findings in the immunized mice showed bronchioles clear from inflammatory cells and normal texture of the spleen and liver. The findings support the use of a multivalent vaccine to induce broadly reactive antibody responses against heterologous A. baumannii strains.	2022 Jul	Zahra Akbari, Iraj Rasooli, Mohammad Hossein Ghaini, Somshukla Chaudhuri, Vahid Farshchi Andisi, Abolfazl Jahangiri, Fatemeh Ramezanalizadeh, Anthony B Schryvers	Int Immunopharmacol
35922185	[Risk factors and resistance patterns of invasive <i>Acinetobacter Baumannii</i> infection in Children].	<b>Objective:</b> To understand the risk factors and antibiotics-resistant patterns of invasive <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> infection in Children. <b>Methods:</b> This retrospective study was conducted in 6 tertiary hospitals from January 2016 to December 2018. The basic information, clinical data and the results of antimicrobial susceptibility testing were collected from the 98 pediatric inpatients with <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> isolated from blood or cerebrospinal fluid and analyzed. According to the susceptibility of the infected strains to carbapenems, they were divided into carbapenem-sensitive <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> (CSAB) group and carbapenem-resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> (CRAB) group. According to the possible sources of infection, they were divided into nosocomial infection group and community infection group. Chi-square test or Fisher exact test were used to analyze categorical variables and rank sum test were used to analyze continuous variables. The risk factors of invasive CRAB infection in children were analyzed by Logistic regression. <b>Result:</b> There were 56 males and 42 females in 98 cases. The onset age of patients was 8 (2, 24) months. There were 62 cases (63%) from rural area. A total of 87 cases (89%) were confirmed with bloodstream infection, and 12 cases (12%) confirmed with meningitis (1 case was accompanied with bloodstream infection). In these patients, 66 cases (67%) received invasive medical procedures or surgery, 54 cases (55%) received carbapenems-containing therapy. Twenty-four cases were infected with CRAB, and 74 cases with CSAB. The onset age of cases in CRAB group was lower than that in CSAB group (4 (1, 9) <i>vs.</i> 10 (4, 24) months, <i>Z=</i>-2.16, <i>P</i>=0.031). The proportions of hospitalization in intensive care unit, carbapenem antibiotics using, pneumonia and adverse prognosis in CRAB group were higher than those in CSAB group (6 cases (25%) <i>vs.</i> 4 cases (5%), 18 cases (75%) <i>vs.</i> 36 cases (49%), 17 cases (71%) <i>vs.</i> 17 cases (23%), 6 cases (25%) <i>vs.</i> 4 cases (5%), χ<sup>2</sup>=5.61, 5.09, 18.32, 5.61, all <i>P</i><0.05). Seventy-seven cases were nosocomial infection and 21 cases were hospital-acquired infection. The proportion of children hospitalized in high-risk wards for nosocomial infections, length of hospitalization, number of antimicrobial therapy received and duration of antimicrobial therapy were higher in the hospital associated infection group than those in the community acquired infection group (all <i>P</i><0.05). Logistic regression analysis showed that children from rural area (<i>OR</i>=8.42, 95%<i>CI</i> 1.45-48.88), prior mechanical ventilation (<i>OR</i>=12.62, 95%<i>CI</i> 1.31-121.76), and prior antibiotic therapy (<i>OR</i>=4.90, 95%<i>CI</i> 1.35-17.72) were independent risk factors for CRAB infection. The resistance percentage of CSAB isolates to many classes of antibiotics was <6% except to gentamicin, which was as high as 20% (13/65). All CRAB isolates of resistant to ampicillin-sulbactam (20/20), cefepime (23/23), piperacillin (17/17), meropenem (23/23) and imipenem (24/24) were 100%. The resistance percentage to other antibiotics were up to 42%-96%. <b>Conclusions:</b> Most of invasive <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> infection in children in China are hospital-acquired. The outcome of invasive CRAB infection was poorer than that of CSAB infection. The drug resistance rate of CRAB strains isolated is high. Living in rural area, prior invasive mechanical ventilation and prior antibiotic therapy were independent risk factors for invasive CRAB infection.

35783362	Multidrug-Resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> May Cause Patients to Develop Polymicrobial Bloodstream Infection.	The incidence of polymicrobial bloodstream infections is increasing, the clinical characteristics of polymicrobial <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> bloodstream infections (AB-BSI) are unclear, and there are no reports of polymicrobial AB-BSI in mainland China. Therefore, our objective was to identify the clinical characteristics, risk factors, and outcomes of polymicrobial AB-BSI versus monomicrobial AB-BSI.	2022	Qingqing Chen, Zhencang Zheng, Qingxin Shi, Huijuan Wu, Yuping Li, Cheng Zheng	Can J Infect Dis Med Microbiol
36227120	Acinetobacter nosocomialis Causes as Severe Disease as Acinetobacter baumannii in Northeast Thailand: Underestimated Role of A. nosocomialis in Infection.	Infections by Acinetobacter species are recognized as a serious global threat due to causing severe disease and their high levels of antibiotic resistance. Acinetobacter baumannii is the most prevalent pathogen in the genus, but infection by Acinetobacter nosocomialis has been reported widely. Diagnosis of patients with A. baumannii infection is often misdiagnosed with other Acinetobacter species, especially A. nosocomialis. This study investigated whether there were significant differences in clinical outcomes between patients infected with A. baumannii versus A. nosocomialis in Northeast Thailand, and to characterize serological responses to infection with these pathogens. The results show that A. baumannii had higher levels of multidrug resistance. Despite this, clinical outcomes for infection with A. baumannii or A. nosocomialis were similar with mortalities of 33% and 36%, respectively. Both pathogens caused community-acquired infections (A. baumannii 35% and A. nosocomialis 29% of cases). Plasma from uninfected healthy controls contained IgG antibody that recognized both organisms, and infected patients did not show a significantly enhanced antibody response from the first week versus 2 weeks later. Finally, the patterns of antigen recognition for plasma IgG were similar for patients infected with A. baumannii or A. nosocomialis infection, and distinct to the pattern for patients infected with non-Acinetobacter. In conclusion, our data revealed that infection with A. nosocomialis was associated with a similarly high level of mortality as infection with A. baumannii, the high rate of community-acquired infection and antibodies in uninfected individuals suggesting that there is significant community exposure to both pathogens. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Bacterial infections by Acinetobacter species are global threats due to their severity and high levels of antibiotic resistance. A. baumannii is the most common pathogen in the genus; however, infection by A. nosocomialis has also been widely reported but is thought to be less severe. In this study, we have prospectively investigated 48 reported cases of A. baumannii infection in Northeast Thailand, and characterized the serological responses to infection. We found that 14 (29%) of these infections were actually caused by A. nosocomialis. Furthermore, the incidence of antibiotic resistance among A. nosocomialis strains, APACHE II scores, and mortality for patients infected with A. nosocomialis were much higher than published data. Both A. baumannii and A. nosocomialis had unexpectedly mortality rates of over 30%, and both pathogens caused a high rate of community-acquired infections. Importantly, background antibodies in uninfected individuals suggest significant community exposure to both pathogens in the environment.	2022 Dec	Arnone Nithichanon, Chidchamai Kewcharoenwong, Hudadini Da-Oh, Sirithorn Surajinda, Aranya Khongmee, Surathinee Koosakunwat, Brendan W Wren, Richard A Stabler, Jeremy S Brown, Ganjana Lertmemongkolchai	Microbiol Spectr
36353984	Antimicrobial and antibiofilm activities of desloratadine against multidrug-resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>.	<b>Aim:</b> The antimicrobial and antibiofilm activities of the antihistamine desloratadine against multidrug-resistant (MDR) <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> were evaluated. <b>Results:</b> Desloratadine inhibited 90% bacterial growth at a concentration of 64 μg/ml. The combination of desloratadine with meropenem reduced the MIC by twofold in the planktonic state and increased the antibiofilm activity by eightfold. Survival curves showed that combinations of these drugs were successful in eradicating all bacterial cells within 16 h. Scanning electron microscopy also confirmed a synergistic effect in imparting a harmful effect on the cellular structure of MDR <i>A. baumannii</i>. An <i>in vivo</i> model showed significant protection of up to 83% of <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> infected with MDR <i>A. baumannii</i>. <b>Conclusion:</b> Our results indicate that repositioning of desloratadine may be a safe and low-cost alternative as an antimicrobial and antibiofilm agent for the treatment of MDR <i>A. baumannii</i> infections.	2023 Jan	Junio Eduvirgem, Luana Rossato, Andressa Lf Melo, Anna Cm Valiente, Luiz F Plaça, Heberton Wender, Marcia Sm Vaz, Suzana M Ribeiro, Simone Simionatto	Future Microbiol
35741297	Performance Evaluation of the VITEK2 and Sensititre Systems to Determine Colistin Resistance and MIC for <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>.	Performances of the colistin antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) systems of <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> vary depending on the manufacturer, and data on colistin-resistant <i>A. baumannii</i> are limited. We evaluated the VITEK2 and Sensititre systems to determine colistin resistance and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for <i>A. baumannii</i> isolated from a clinical microbiology laboratory. A total of 213 clinical <i>A. baumannii</i> isolates were tested, including 81 colistin-resistant <i>A. baumannii</i>. ASTs were performed using the VITEK2 and Sensititre systems according to the manufacturer's instructions. Reference MICs for colistin were determined using the manual broth microdilution method (BMD). The results of the two AST methods were compared with the BMD results. VITEK2 and Sensititre systems showed category agreements of 95.3% and 99.1%, respectively. VITEK2 had a relatively high very major error (VME) rate (9.9%). Sensititre reported higher MICs than the reference method for the susceptible isolates and showed low essential agreement. In conclusion, the automated systems investigated in this study showed good category agreements for colistin AST of <i>A. baumannii</i>. However, VITEK2 had a high VME rate, and Sensititre had differences in MIC results. Colistin AST remains a challenging task in the clinical laboratory.	2022 Jun	Hae-Sun Chung, Soo-Kyung Kim, Chorong Hahm, Miae Lee	Diagnostics (Basel)
36145776	Antibacterial Activities of Monsonia Angustifolia and Momordica Balsamina Linn Extracts against Carbapenem-Resistant Acinetobacter Baumannii.	Carbapenemase-producing <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> (<i>A. baumannii</i>) is resistant to most of the available antibiotics and poses serious therapeutic challenges. The study investigated <i>Monsonia angustifolia</i> (<i>M. angustifolia</i>) and <i>Momordica balsamina Linn</i> (<i>M. balsamina Linn</i>) extracts for antibacterial activity against a clinical isolate of carbapenemase-producing <i>A. baumannii</i> using the Kirby Bauer disc diffusion and TLC coupled with bioautography. MIC determination experiments were conducted on a molecularly characterized <i>A. baumannii</i> isolate identified using VITEK2. Positive PCR detection of <i>bla<sub>OXA-51</sub></i> and <i>bla<sub>OXA-23</sub></i> confirmed isolate identity and the presence of a carbapenemase-encoding gene. Antibacterial activity was observed with the methanolic extract of <i>M. balsamina Linn</i> with a MIC of 0.5 mg/mL. Compounds with Rf values of 0.05; 0.17; 0.39 obtained from <i>M. angustifolia</i> hexane extract; compounds with Rf values of 0.58; 0.78; 0.36; 0.48; 0.5; 0.56; 0.67; 0.9 obtained from <i>M. angustifolia</i> dichloromethane extract; compounds with Rf values of 0.11; 0.56; 0.24; 0.37 obtained from <i>M. angustifolia</i> acetone extract and compounds with Rf values of 0.11; 0.27 obtained from <i>M. angustifolia</i> methanol extract demonstrated a level of antibacterial activity. <i>M. angustifolia</i> and <i>M. balsamina Linn</i> plant extracts have a clinically significant antibacterial activity against a carbapenemase-producing <i>A. baumannii</i> strain.	2022 Sep	Noel-David Nogbou, Dimpho Raesibe Mabela, Buang Matseke, Ntwanano Sipho Mapfumari, Mmammosheledi Elsie Mothibe, Lawrence Chikwelu Obi, Andrew Munyalo Musyoki	Plants (Basel)
36976008	Heterocyclic Diaryliodonium-Based Inhibitors of Carbapenem-Resistant Acinetobacter baumannii.	Finding new therapeutic strategies against Gram-negative pathogens such as Acinetobacter baumannii is challenging. Starting from diphenyleneiodonium (dPI) salts, which are moderate Gram-positive antibacterials, we synthesized a focused heterocyclic library and found a potent inhibitor of patient-derived multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii strains that significantly reduced bacterial burden in an animal model of infection caused by carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB), listed as a priority 1 critical pathogen by the World Health Organization. Next, using advanced chemoproteomics platforms and activity-based protein profiling (ABPP), we identified and biochemically validated betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase (BetB), an enzyme that is involved in the metabolism and maintenance of osmolarity, as a potential target for this compound. Together, using a new class of heterocyclic iodonium salts, a potent CRAB inhibitor was identified, and our study lays the foundation for the identification of new druggable targets against this critical pathogen. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Discovery of novel antibiotics targeting multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens such as A. baumannii is an urgent, unmet medical need. Our work has highlighted the potential of this unique scaffold to annihilate MDR A. baumannii alone and in combination with amikacin both <i>in vitro</i> and in animals, that too without inducing resistance. Further in depth analysis identified central metabolism to be a putative target. Taken together, these experiments lay down the foundation for effective management of infections caused due to highly MDR pathogens.	2023 Mar	Pooja Kumari, Grace Kaul, T Anand Kumar, Abdul Akhir, Manjulika Shukla, Suraj Sharma, Siddhesh S Kamat, Sidharth Chopra, Harinath Chakrapani	Microbiol Spectr
35749906	An electrochemical assay for sensitive detection of Acinetobacter baumannii gene.	A new genosensor, which allows sensitive and selective detection of Acinetobacter baumannii gene sequence was developed herein. In this assay, capture probe of Acinetobacter baumannii was immobilized on the surface of chitosan modified single-use pencil graphite electrodes (c-PGEs) to obtain Acinetobacter baumannii genosensor. Then, Acinetobacter baumannii target DNA sequence was recognized after solid-state hybridization on c-PGE genosensor by measuring guanine signal via differential pulse voltammetry (DPV). In order to improve hybridization efficiency, experimental parameters affecting all assay steps are studied and the analytical performance of the genosensor was tested. The low limit of detection (LOD) for Acinetobacter baumannii target DNA sequence was obtained as 1.86 nM with developed genosensor. The selectivity of the proposed assay was then tested in the presence of 1-base mismatch, or two different type of non-complementary sequences and no interference effect was observed. The proposed electrochemical assay protocol is easy, convenient, and rapid which can be a decent alternative to existing methods.	2022 Nov	Ece Eksin	Talanta
35543248	Chemical Synthesis and Antigenic Evaluation of Inner Core Oligosaccharides from Acinetobacter baumannii Lipopolysaccharide.	Acinetobacter baumannii is currently posing a serious threat to global health. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a potent virulence factor of pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria. To explore the antigenic properties of A. baumannii LPS, four Kdo-containing inner core glycans from A. baumannii strain ATCC 17904 were synthesized. A flexible and divergent method based on the use of the orthogonally substituted α-Kdo-(2→5)-Kdo disaccharides was developed. Selective removal of different protecting groups in these key precursors and elongation of sugar chain via α-stereocontrolled coupling with 5,7-O-di-tert-butylsilylene or 5-O-benzoyl protected Kdo thioglycosides and 2-azido-2-deoxyglucosyl thioglycoside allowed efficient assembly of the target molecules. Glycan microarray analysis of sera from infected patients revealed that the 4,5-branched Kdo trimer was a potential antigenic epitope, which is attractive for further immunological research to develop carbohydrate vaccines against A. baumannii.	2022 Jul	Xian-Yang Zhou, Ling-Xin Li, Zhen Zhang, Shi-Chao Duan, Ying-Wen Huang, Yi-Yang Luo, Xiao-Dong Mu, Zhi-Wei Chen, Yong Qin, Jing Hu, Jian Yin, Jin-Song Yang	Angew Chem Int Ed Engl

36442439	Synthesis and antibiofilm evaluation of N-acyl-2-aminopyrimidine derivatives against Acinetobacter baumannii.	The overuse of antibiotics will led to the increase of drug resistance. Especially, the multidrug-resistant A. baumannii became the leading cause of nosocomial infections with high rates of morbimortality. The drug resistance of A. baumannii is greatly attributed to its biofilm. To alleviate the burden of drug resistance, the anti-virulence signaling strategies was developed. By specifically interfering with the ability of the bacteria to recognize host signals that are needed to establish infection, the bacteria are less able to colonize the host. In this paper, 39 N-acyl-2-aminopyrimidine derivatives were synthesized and tested for their biofilm inhibition efficacy. The screening results reveal that some of the analogues (3ac, 8d) efficiently inhibited the biofilm formation of A. baumannii (IC<sub>50</sub> as low as 3.8 μM), and the biofilm inhibition ability was further demonstrated with laser confocal results and extracellular polysaccharides inhibition test. Further motility test reveals our compounds are quorum sensing inhibitors. Besides, the synergistic effect of compounds 3ac and 8d with different antibiotics suggest its potential clinical significance, which was further enhanced by the long time biofilm inhibition test after coating with PLGA. Finally, we also look into the safety of the compounds with cytotoxicity assay.	2022 Dec	Xue-Min Jia, Cheng Cheng, Ting Liu, Yong-Long Zhao, Bing Guo, Lei Tang, Yuan-Yong Yang	Bioorg Med Chem

36830106	Uncovering the Secretion Systems of <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>: Structures and Functions in Pathogenicity and Antibiotic Resistance.	Infections led by <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> strains are of great concern in healthcare environments due to the strong ability of the bacteria to spread through different apparatuses and develop drug resistance. Severe diseases can be caused by <i>A. baumannii</i> in critically ill patients, but its biological process and mechanism are not well understood. Secretion systems have recently been demonstrated to be involved in the pathogenic process, and five types of secretion systems out of the currently known six from Gram-negative bacteria have been found in <i>A. baumannii</i>. They can promote the fitness and pathogenesis of the bacteria by releasing a variety of effectors. Additionally, antibiotic resistance is found to be related to some types of secretion systems. In this review, we describe the genetic and structural compositions of the five secretion systems that exist in <i>Acinetobacter</i>. In addition, the function and molecular mechanism of each secretion system are summarized to explain how they enable these critical pathogens to overcome eukaryotic hosts and prokaryotic competitors to cause diseases.	2023 Jan	Pu Li, Sirui Zhang, Jingdan Wang, Mona Mohamed Al-Shamiri, Bei Han, Yanjiong Chen, Shaoshan Han, Lei Han	Antibiotics (Basel)
36498165	Transcriptome Analysis of <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> in Rapid Response to Subinhibitory Concentration of Minocycline.	The increasing emergence of multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii brings great threats to public health. Minocycline is a kind of semisynthetic derivative of the antibacterial drug tetracycline and is often used to treat infections caused by multidrug-resistant A. baumannii with other antibiotics. However, minocycline-resistant A. baumannii appears constantly. To rapidly explore the response of A. baumannii to minocycline stress, RNA-seq was carried out to compare the difference in the transcriptome of A. baumannii ATCC19606 in the presence or absence of minocycline. The results showed that 25 genes were differentially expressed, including 10 downregulated genes and 15 upregulated genes, and 24 sRNA were upregulated and 24 were downregulated based on the filter criteria (Log2FC > 1 or <−1 and FDR < 0.05). RtcB family protein and ABC transporter ATP-binding protein were upregulated by 2.6- and 11.3-fold, and molecular chaperone GroES, chaperonin GroL, class C beta-lactamase ADC-158, amino acid ABC transporter permease, and APC family permease were downregulated by at least two-fold in the presence of half-MIC minocycline. The differentially expressed genes are mainly involved in the stress response, the GroES/GroEL chaperonin system, and transport metabolic pathways. sRNA 1248 was significantly upregulated, and sRNA 1767, 5182, and 6984 were downregulated in a rapid response to minocycline. These results provide insights into the adaptive mechanism of A. baumannii to minocycline.	2022 Dec	Lili Gao, Xiaochun Ma	Int J Environ Res Public Health

The current review attempts to present an overview of various mechanisms (enzymatic and non-enzymatic), virulence factors responsible for A. baumannii resistance. Furthermore, inhibitors of A. baumannii are categorized into different classes highlighting their MDR inhibition properties. In addition, novel adjuvants that potentiate existing antibiotics, as well as natural and synthetic compounds that limit biofilm formation in A. baumannii infections are discussed.	2022 Jul	Danaboina Srikanth, Swanand Vinayak Joshi, Mahammad Ghouse Shaik, Gaurav Pawar, Sushmitha Bujji, Vinaykumar Kanchupalli, Sidharth Chopra, Srinivas Nanduri	Bioorg Chem
36920192	Probiotic <i>Lactobacillus</i> Species and Their Biosurfactants Eliminate Acinetobacter baumannii Biofilm in Various Manners.	Acinetobacter baumannii is a critical biofilm-forming pathogen that has presented great challenges in the clinic due to multidrug resistance. Thus, new methods of intervention are needed to control biofilm-associated infections. In this study, among three tested <i>Lactobacillus</i> species, Lactobacillus rhamnosus showed significant antimaturation and antiadherence effects against A. baumannii biofilm. Lactic acid (LA) and acetic acid (AA) were the most effective antibiofilm biosurfactants (BSs) produced by L. rhamnosus. This antibiofilm phenomenon produced by LA and AA was due to the strong bactericidal effect, which worked from very early time points, as determined by colony enumeration and confocal laser scanning microscope. The cell destruction of A. baumannii appeared in both the cell envelope and cytoplasm. A discontinuous cell envelope, the leakage of cell contents, and the increased extracellular activity of ATPase demonstrated the disruption of the cell membrane by LA and AA. These effects also demonstrated the occurrence of protein lysis. In addition, bacterial DNA interacted with and was damaged by LA and AA, resulting in significantly reduced expression of biofilm and DNA repair genes. The results highlight the possibility and importance of using probiotics in clinical prevention. Probiotics can be utilized as novel biocides to block and decrease biofilm formation and microbial contamination in medical equipment and during the treatment of infections. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> A. baumannii biofilm is a significant virulence factor that causes the biofilm colonization of invasive illnesses. Rising bacterial resistance to synthetic antimicrobials has prompted researchers to look at natural alternatives, such as probiotics and their derivatives. In this study, L. rhamnosus and its BSs (LA and AA) demonstrated remarkable antibiofilm and antimicrobial characteristics, with a significant inhibitory effect on A. baumannii. These effects were achieved by several mechanisms, including the disruption of the cell envelope membrane, protein lysis, reduced expression of biofilm-related genes, and destruction of bacterial DNA. The results provide support for the possibility of using probiotics and their derivatives in the clinical prevention and therapy of A. baumannii infections.	2023 Mar	Mona Mohamed Al-Shamiri, Jingdan Wang, Sirui Zhang, Pu Li, Woodvine Otieno Odhiambo, Yanjiong Chen, Bei Han, E Yang, Meng Xun, Lei Han, Shaoshan Han	Microbiol Spectr

35743027	Evasion of Antimicrobial Activity in <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> by Target Site Modifications: An Effective Resistance Mechanism.	<i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> is a Gram-negative bacillus that causes multiple infections that can become severe, mainly in hospitalized patients. Its high ability to persist on abiotic surfaces and to resist stressors, together with its high genomic plasticity, make it a remarkable pathogen. Currently, the isolation of strains with high antimicrobial resistance profiles has gained relevance, which complicates patient treatment and prognosis. This resistance capacity is generated by various mechanisms, including the modification of the target site where antimicrobial action is directed. This mechanism is mainly generated by genetic mutations and contributes to resistance against a wide variety of antimicrobials, such as β-lactams, macrolides, fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides, among others, including polymyxin resistance, which includes colistin, a rescue antimicrobial used in the treatment of multidrug-resistant strains of <i>A. baumannii</i> and other Gram-negative bacteria. Therefore, the aim of this review is to provide a detailed and up-to-date description of antimicrobial resistance mediated by the target site modification in <i>A. baumannii</i>, as well as to detail the therapeutic options available to fight infections caused by this bacterium.	2022 Jun	Arturo Martínez-Trejo, Juan Manuel Ruiz-Ruiz, Luis Uriel Gonzalez-Avila, Andrés Saldaña-Padilla, Cecilia Hernández-Cortez, Miguel Angel Loyola-Cruz, Juan Manuel Bello-López, Graciela Castro-Escarpulli	Int J Mol Sci
35763257	Phenotypic, genomic, and transcriptomic changes in an Acinetobacter baumannii strain after spaceflight in China's Tiangong-2 space laboratory.	Acinetobacter baumannii is an opportunistic pathogen often found in patients with low immunity. It causes nosocomial infections, which are difficult to treat. This bacterium can rapidly mutate, developing resistance to antimicrobials and adapting to environmental stress, thereby increasing its survival. Understanding such adaptive mechanisms will be beneficial for controlling the spread of A. baumannii. Astrobiology studies have demonstrated that microbiomes from astronauts and manned spaceflight environments show resistance to stress and antibiotics. Astronauts also encounter low immunity during spaceflight missions. The extreme conditions of spaceflight provide a unique research platform for studying how opportunistic pathogens such as A. baumannii adapt to conditions such as microgravity and mutate during spaceflight. In this study, we compared phenotypic variations and analyzed genomic and transcriptomic variations in A. baumannii strains exposed to three different conditions: ST1 (64 days on Tiangong-2 space laboratory), GT1 (ground control), and Aba (original strain). Biofilm formation ability of the ST1 strain increased after 64 days of spaceflight. In addition, high-throughput sequencing revealed that some differentially expressed genes were upregulated in the ST1 strain compared to the GT1 strain. These results provide insights into the environmental adaptation of this widespread pathogen.	2022 Sep	Xian Zhao, Yi Yu, Xuelin Zhang, Bing Huang, Chou Xu, Bin Zhang, Po Bai, Changting Liu	Braz J Microbiol
36212889	Metabolomic profiling of polymyxin-B in combination with meropenem and sulbactam against multi-drug resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>.	Empirical therapies using polymyxins combined with other antibiotics are recommended in the treatment of <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> infections. In the present study, the synergistic activities of polymyxin-B, meropenem, and sulbactam as combination therapy were investigated using metabolomic analysis. The metabolome of <i>A. baumannii</i> was investigated after treatment with polymyxin-B alone (2 mg/l), meropenem (2 mg/l) alone, combination of polymyxin-B/meropenem at their clinical breakpoints, and triple-antibiotic combination of polymyxin-B/meropenem and 4 mg/l sulbactam. The triple-antibiotic combination significantly changed the metabolite levels involved in cell outer membrane and cell wall biosynthesis, including fatty acid, glycerophospholipid, lipopolysaccharide, peptidoglycan, and nucleotide within 15 min of administration. In contrast, significant changes in metabolome were observed after 1 h in sample treated with either meropenem or polymyxin-B alone. After 1 h of administration, the double and triple combination therapies significantly disrupted nucleotide and amino acid biosynthesis pathways as well as the central carbon metabolism, including pentose phosphate and glycolysis/gluconeogenesis pathways, and tricarboxylic acid cycle. The addition of sulbactam to polymyxin-B and meropenem combination appeared to be an early disruptor of <i>A. baumannii</i> metabolome, which paves the way for further antibiotic penetration into bacteria cells. Combination antibiotics consisting of sulbactam/meropenem/polymyxin-B can effectively confer susceptibility to <i>A. baumannii</i> harboring OXA-23 and other drug resistant genes. Metabolomic profiling reveals underlying mechanisms of synergistic effects of polymyxin-B combined with meropenem and sulbactam against multi-drug resistant <i>A. baumannii.</i>	2022	Shixing Zhu, Jiayuan Zhang, Chu Song, Yuwei Liu, Charles Oo, M Tobias Heinrichs, Zhihua Lv, Yuanqi Zhu, Sherwin K B Sy, Pan Deng, Mingming Yu	Front Microbiol
36314559	Kinetic and Structural Characterization of a Flavin-Dependent Putrescine <i>N</i>-Hydroxylase from <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>.	<i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> is a Gram-negative opportunistic pathogen that causes nosocomial infections, especially among immunocompromised individuals. The rise of multidrug resistant strains of <i>A. baumannii</i> has limited the use of standard antibiotics, highlighting a need for new drugs that exploit novel mechanisms of pathogenicity. Disrupting iron acquisition by inhibiting the biosynthesis of iron-chelating molecules (siderophores) secreted by the pathogen is a potential strategy for developing new antibiotics. Here we investigated FbsI, an <i>N</i>-hydroxylating monooxygenase involved in the biosynthesis of fimsbactin A, the major siderophore produced by <i>A. baumannii.</i> FbsI was characterized using steady-state and transient-state kinetics, spectroscopy, X-ray crystallography, and small-angle X-ray scattering. FbsI was found to catalyze the <i>N</i>-hydroxylation of the aliphatic diamines putrescine and cadaverine. Maximum coupling of the reductive and oxidative half-reactions occurs with putrescine, suggesting it is the preferred (<i>in vivo</i>) substrate. FbsI uses both NADPH and NADH as the reducing cofactor with a slight preference for NADPH. The crystal structure of FbsI complexed with NADP<sup>+</sup> was determined at 2.2 Å resolution. The structure exhibits the protein fold characteristic of Class B flavin-dependent monooxygenases. FbsI is most similar in 3D structure to the cadaverine <i>N</i>-hydroxylases DesB and DfoA. Small-angle X-ray scattering shows that FbsI forms a tetramer in solution like the <i>N</i>-hydroxylating monooxygenases of the SidA/IucD/PvdA family. A model of putrescine docked into the active site provides insight into substrate recognition. A mechanism for the catalytic cycle is proposed where dehydration of the C4a-hydroxyflavin intermediate is partially rate-limiting, and the hydroxylated putrescine product is released before NADP<sup>+</sup>.	2022 Nov	Noah S Lyons, Alexandra N Bogner, John J Tanner, Pablo Sobrado	Biochemistry
36265736	Comparative assessment of the mouse immune responses to colistin-resistant and colistin-sensitive isolates of Acinetobacter baumannii.	Acinetobacter baumannii is known as the most frequent species in clinical samples that is responsible for a large number of nosocomial infection outbreaks. The colistin-resistance of this bacterium has been found to be increasing. This study aimed to evaluate the immune response to colistin-susceptible and colistin-resistant A. baumannii isolates in a mouse model. Samples were prepared from the wounds of patients suspected of A. baumannii admitted to the intensive care unit of Namazi Hospital in Shiraz. Antibiotic susceptibility was studied by disk diffusion and broth microdilution according to CLSI and EUCAST criteria. Among the isolates, one colistin-sensitive isolate and one colistin-resistant isolate were injected intraperitoneally to BALB/C mice. Blood samples were collected after 4 h and cytokines (IL1-β, IL-12, IFN γ, and IL-10) and surface markers (CD4, CD8, CD3, and CD45) were determined by ELISA and flow cytometry. Then, hematologic and histopathological factors were analyzed, and colony count in lung, liver, kidney, and spleen tissues were also performed. The results showed that levels of cytokines (IL1-β, IL-12, IFN γ, and IL-10) and markers (CD4, CD8, CD3 and CD45) were higher in mice receiving colistin-resistant A. baumannii isolates than in mice receiving colistin-sensitive A. baumannii isolates, indicating that colistin-resistant isolates 4 h following the intraperitoneal injection stimulated host innate immune system better and produced a stronger immune response. On the other hand, histopathological findings showed inflammatory cell infiltration, hyperemia, and tissue damage. In addition, the bacterial load and tissue damage in the lung was higher than other tissues. The results of this study can have promising potential for the development of a prevention and treatment strategy based on cellular immune response for infection caused by colistin-sensitive and colistin-resistant A. baumannii.	2022 Dec	Shahriar Sepahvand, Mahboobeh Madani, Hassan Sepahvand, Mohammad Ali Davarpanah	Microb Pathog
36084216	Animal model testing for efficacy and adverse effects of bacteriophages against Acinetobacter baumannii.	This study aimed to conduct a detailed study on murine model testing of bacteriophage against Acinetobacter baumannii. These bacteriophages were tested not only for their efficacy in healing wound of murine models infected with multidrug resistant A. baumannii but were also studied for any derangement in hematological parameters as well as liver and kidney function. The study also included any histological changes observed in hepatic and renal tissues of the bacteriophage treated murine animals. This experimental study was conducted at Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Khyber Medical University, Peshawar and Institute of Pure and Applied Biology, Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, Bahauddin Zakariya University, Multan. A. baumannii isolates were obtained from the Microbiology Department, Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, Rawalpindi. Antimicrobial susceptibility was done by using standard procedures and as per Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines. Bacteriophages were isolated from sewage water samples collected from different hospitals in Multan. These bacteriophages were characterized and finally used for treating the murine model and efficacy of phage as a therapeutic option was determined by using superficial rat wound model. In this study, the isolated lytic bacteriophage was effective in relatively faster wound healing of the infected animals. Moreover, there were no significant hematological or renal and hepatic profile changes in treated animals. Histology of renal and hepatic tissues was also normal as compared to control animals. Our study concluded that the isolated phage could serve as an attractive therapeutic candidate to combat the deadly multidrug resistant A. baumannii.	2022 Dec	Aamir Hussain, Ihsan Ullah, Muhammad Q Saeed	J Basic Microbiol
36579124	Molecular Characterization of Carbapenem-Resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> with Special Reference to Carbapenemases: A Systematic Review.	Carbapenemases are β-lactamase enzymes that hydrolyze a variety of β-lactams including carbapenem and belong to different Ambler classes (A, B, D). These enzymes can be encoded by plasmid or chromosomal-mediated genes. The major issues associated with carbapenemases-producing organisms are compromising the activity and increasing the resistance to carbapenems which are the last resort antibiotics used in treating serious infections. The global increase of pathogen, carbapenem-resistant <i>A. baumannii</i> has significantly threatened public health. Thus, there is a pressing need for a better understanding of this pathogen, to know the various carbapenem resistance encoding genes and dissemination of resistance genes from <i>A. baumannii</i> which help in developing strategies to overcome this problem. The horizontal transfer of resistant determinants through mobile genetic elements increases the incidence of multidrug, extensive drug, and Pan-drug resistant <i>A. baumannii</i>. Therefore, the current review aims to know the various mechanisms of carbapenem resistance, categorize and discuss carbapenemases encoding genes and various mobile genetic elements, and the prevalence of carbapenemase genes in recent years in <i>A. baumannii</i> from various geographical regions.	2022	Neetu Gupta, Kalpana Angadi, Savita Jadhav	Infect Drug Resist
35277885	Structure and function of an N-acetyltransferase from the human pathogen Acinetobacter baumannii isolate BAL_212.	Acinetobacter baumannii is a Gram-negative bacterium commonly found in soil and water that can cause human infections of the blood, lungs, and urinary tract. Of particular concern is its prevalence in health-care settings where it can survive on surfaces and shared equipment for extended periods of time. The capsular polysaccharide surrounding the organism is known to be the major contributor to virulence. The structure of the K57 capsular polysaccharide produced by A. baumannii isolate BAL_212 from Vietnam was recently shown to contain the rare sugar 4-acetamido-4,6-dideoxy-d-glucose. Three enzymes are required for its biosynthesis, one of which is encoded by the gene H6W49_RS17300 and referred to as VioB, a putative N-acetyltransferase. Here, we describe a combined structural and functional analysis of VioB. Kinetic analyses show that the enzyme does, indeed, function on dTDP-4-amino-4,6-dideoxy-d-glucose with a catalytic efficiency of 3.9 x 10<sup>4</sup>  M<sup>-1</sup>  s<sup>-1</sup> (±6000), albeit at a reduced value compared to similar enzymes. Three high-resolution X-ray structures of various enzyme/ligand complexes were determined to resolutions of 1.65 Å or better. One of these models represents an intermediate analogue of the tetrahedral transition state. Differences between the VioB structure and those determined for the N-acetyltransferases from Campylobacter jejuni (PglD), Caulobacter crescentus (PerB), and Psychrobacter cryohalolentis (Pcryo_0637) are highlighted. Taken together, this investigation sheds new insight into the Type I sugar N-acetyltransferases.	2022 Aug	Noah R Herkert, James B Thoden, Hazel M Holden	Proteins

35995289	Bioremediation of petroleum-contaminated saline soil by Acinetobacter baumannii and Talaromyces sp. and functional potential analysis using metagenomic sequencing.	Microbial remediation is a potential remediation method for petroleum-contaminated soil. In order to explore the petroleum degradation mechanism by microorganisms, the oilfield soil was remedied by Acinetobacter baumannii combined with Talaromyces sp. The degradation mechanism was studied by analyzing soil microbial community and functional genes through metagenomics during the degradation process. The result showed the degradation rate of petroleum was 65.6% after 28 days. The concentration of petroleum decreased from 1220 mg/kg to 420 mg/kg. In the co-culture group, Acinetobacter baumannii became the dominant species, the annotated genes of it at the species level accounted for 7.34% while that of Talaromyces sp. accounted for only 0.34%. Meanwhile, the annotated genes of Bacillus, Halomonas, and Nitriliruptor at the genus level were up-regulated by 1.83%, 0.90%, and 0.71%, respectively. In addition, large functional genes were significantly up-regulated, including the peroxisome, P450 enzyme (CYP53, CYP116, CYP102, CYP645), and biofilm formulation, promoting the oxidation and hydroxylation, and catalyzing the epoxidation of aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons. Meanwhile, the degrading genes of alkanes and aromatic hydrocarbons were expressed promotionally, and degradation pathways were deduced. In conclusion, the inoculation of Acinetobacter baumannii combined with Talaromyces sp. accelerated the degradation of petroleum in oilfield soil and improved the growth of indigenous petroleum-degrading bacteria. Many functional genes related to petroleum degradation were promoted significantly. These results proved the co-culture of bacteria-fungi consortium contributes to the bioremediation of petroleum-contaminated soil.	2022 Oct	Xiaoyan Liu, Lihong He, Xinying Zhang, Dewen Kong, Zongze Chen, Jia Lin, Chuanhua Wang	Environ Pollut
36227610	Interactions between host epithelial cells and <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> promote the emergence of highly antibiotic resistant and highly mucoid strains.	<i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> is an important nosocomial pathogen. Upon colonizing a host, <i>A. baumannii</i> are subjected to selective pressure by immune defenses as they adapt to the host environment. However, the mechanism of this pathoadaptation is unknown. Here, we established an <i>in vitro</i> system to evolve <i>A. baumannii</i> driven by the continuous selective pressure exerted by epithelial cells, and we used a combination of experimental evolution, phenotypic characterization and multi-omics analysis to address the underlying mechanism. When continuously exposed to selective pressure by pulmonary epithelial cells, <i>A. baumannii</i> showed <i>ptk</i> mutation-mediated mucoid conversion (reduced adhesion and increased anti-phagocytic ability) by enhancement of capsular exopolysaccharide chain length; <i>rsmG</i> mutation-mediated deficiency of 7-methylguanosine modification in the 524th nucleotide of 16S rRNA, which increased ribosome translation efficiency; and <i>rnaseI</i> mutation-mediated changes in outer membrane permeability and efflux pump expression. Together, these mutations altered susceptibility to a variety of antimicrobial agents, including the novel antibiotic cefiderocol, by regulating siderophore and siderophore-receptor biosynthesis. In conclusion, pulmonary epithelial cells modulate <i>A. baumannii</i> pathoadaptation, implicating the host-microbe interaction in the survival and persistence of <i>A. baumannii</i>.	2022 Dec	Wang Zhang, Yue Yao, Hua Zhou, Jintao He, Jingfen Wang, Li Li, Minsong Gao, Xiaochen Liu, Ya Shi, Jinzhong Lin, Jianzhao Liu, Huan Chen, Yu Feng, Zhihui Zhou, Yunsong Yu, Xiaoting Hua	Emerg Microbes Infect
33855919	Emergence of carbapenem resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> clonal complexes CC2 and CC10 among fecal carriages in an educational hospital.	Carbapenem-resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> strains are increasing worldwide. In this study, samples were collected from hospital environments, extra hospital environments, and fecal carriages. 76% (89/117) of bacterial isolates were detected as <i>A. baumannii</i> strains. The imipenem resistance in the hospital environment, fecal carriages, extra hospital environments, and clinical isolates was 37.7% (17/45), 100% (9/9), 0% (0/45), and 92.9% (92/99), respectively. The <i>bla</i>VIM and <i>bla</i>OXA-23 were detected in 6.6% (3/45) and 2.2% (1/45) of strains isolated from hospital environments. Interestingly, strains isolated from fecal carriages had <i>bla</i>VIM, <i>bla</i>OXA-23, and <i>bla</i>IMP genes which resembled carbapenem resistance genes in clinical strains. The structure of clonal relatedness among all non-clinical isolates was as follows: CC2, 37% (33/89); CC1, 22.4% (20/89); CC3, 12.3% (11/89); CC25, 7.8% (7/89); CC10, 4.4% (4/89) and CC15, 2.2% (2/89). Comparison of clonal relatedness among clinical and non-clinical isolates indicated that widespread clones including CC2, CC3, and CC10 were common clonal complexes between two categories.	2022 Jul	Mohsen Nazari, Omid Azizi, Hamid Solgi, Sepideh Fereshteh, Shervin Shokouhi, Farzad Badmasti	Int J Environ Health Res
35276227	Dynamics of the Acinetobacter baumannii inner membrane under exogenous polyunsaturated fatty acid stress.	Exogenous polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are readily incorporated into the synthesis pathways of A. baumannii membrane phospholipids, where they contribute to reduced bacterial fitness and increased antimicrobial susceptibility. Here we examine the impact of PUFA membrane modification on membrane organisation and biophysical properties using coarse grained MARTINI simulations of chemically representative membrane models developed from mass-spectrometry datasets of an untreated, arachidonic acid (AA) treated and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) treated A. baumannii membranes. Enzymatic integration of AA or DHA into phospholipids of the A. baumannii membrane resulted in modulation of membrane biophysical properties. Membrane thickness decreased slightly following PUFA treatment, concomitant with changes in the lateral area per lipid of each lipid headgroup class. PUFA treatment resulted in a decrease in membrane ordering and an increase in lipid lateral diffusion. Changes in lateral membrane organisation were observed in the PUFA treated membranes, with a concurrent increase in ordered cardiolipin domains and disordered PUFA-containing domains. Notably, separation between ordered and disordered domains was enhanced and was more pronounced for DHA relative to AA, providing a possible mechanism for greater antimicrobial action of DHA relative to AA observed experimentally. Furthermore, the membrane active antimicrobial, pentamidine, preferentially adsorbs to cardiolipin domains of the A. baumannii model membranes. This interaction, and membrane penetration of pentamidine, was enhanced following PUFA treatment. Cumulatively, this work explores the wide-ranging effects of PUFA incorporation on the A. baumannii membrane and provides a molecular basis for bacterial inner membrane disruption by PUFAs.	2022 Jul	Hugo I MacDermott-Opeskin, Alessandra Panizza, Bart A Eijkelkamp, Megan L O'Mara	Biochim Biophys Acta Biomembr
36695425	Evaluation of CHROMagar Acinetobacter and MacConkey media for the recovery of Acinetobacter baumannii from soil samples.	The opportunistic pathogen Acinetobacter baumannii occupies niches in human and veterinary clinics and other environments. This comparative study was designed to assess the recovery rate of Ac. baumannii from 20 soil samples collected in Germany (from which Ac. baumannii had been previously isolated) on selective CHROMagar Acinetobacter (CMA) and MacConkey Agar (MCA). Suspected Ac. baumannii were confirmed by detection and sequencing of blaOXA-51-like genes. Overall, the recovery rate of Ac. baumannii from both media was similar. Out of the 20 soil samples enriched in mineral salt medium (MM) plus 0.2% acetate for 5 h, Ac. baumannii was recovered from 12 (60%) on CMA and 11 (55%) on MCA, and from 14 (70%) with both selective media after enrichment for 24 h. Typical and distinct colonies of Ac. baumannii were more often observed on CMA with soil enriched in MM for 5 h, while on MCA distinct colonies were more obvious after 24 h. In five soil samples (25%), strains harbouring different OXA-51-like variants were recovered on MCA. Late lactose fermentation (48 h) was observed on MCA. The study suggests that no single growth medium would efficiently recover Ac. baumannii from all soil samples.	2023 Feb	I Yusuf, E Skiebe, G Wilharm	Lett Appl Microbiol

36071964	Molecular epidemiology and carbapenem resistance characteristics of <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> causing bloodstream infection from 2009 to 2018 in northwest China.	Bloodstream infection (BSI) caused by <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> poses a serious threat to health and is correlated with high mortality in patients with hospital-acquired infections, so the molecular epidemiology and antimicrobial resistance characteristics of this pathogen urgently need to be explored. <i>A. baumannii</i> isolates from BSI patients were collected in three tertiary hospitals in northwest China from 2009 to 2018. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was used to determine the MICs of the <i>A. baumannii</i> isolates. Whole-genome sequencing based on the Illumina platform was performed for molecular epidemiological analyses and acquired resistance gene screening. The efflux pump phenotype was detected by examining the influence of an efflux pump inhibitor. The expression of efflux pump genes was evaluated by RT-PCR. In total, 47 <i>A. baumannii</i> isolates causing BSI were collected and they presented multidrug resistance, including resistance to carbapenems. Clone complex (CC) 92 was the most prevalent with 30 isolates, among which a cluster was observed in the phylogenetic tree based on the core genome multi-locus sequence type, indicating the dissemination of a dominant clone. BSI-related <i>A. baumannii</i> isolates normally harbour multiple resistance determinants, of which oxacillinase genes are most common. Except for the intrinsic <i>bla</i> <sub>OXA-51</sub> family, there are some carbapenem-resistant determinants in these <i>A. baumannii</i> isolates, including <i>bla</i> <sub>OXA-23</sub>, which is encoded within the Tn<i>2006</i>, Tn<i>2008</i> or Tn<i>2009</i> transposon structures and <i>bla</i> <sub>OXA-72</sub>. The transfer of <i>bla</i> <sub>OXA-72</sub> was suggested by XerC/D site-specific recombination. The AdeABC efflux pump system contributed to carbapenem resistance in <i>A. baumannii</i> isolates, as evidenced by the high expression of some of its encoding genes. Both the clone dissemination and carbapenem resistance mediated by oxacillinase or efflux pumps suggest an effective strategy for hospital infection control.	2022	Yihai Gu, Wei Zhang, Jine Lei, Lixia Zhang, Xuan Hou, Junqi Tao, Hui Wang, Minghui Deng, Mengrong Zhou, Rui Weng, Jiru Xu	Front Microbiol

35970267	Therapeutic evaluation of the Acinetobacter baumannii phage Phab24 for clinical use.	Phages have shown to be effective in treating bacterial infections. However, when evaluating the therapeutic potential of novel phage isolates which have the ability to infect and kill a pathogen, it is important to include parameters such as stability (crucial for storage and delivery), infection dynamics in vitro and in vivo (for efficacy and dosing), and an in-depth genome analysis (to exclude the presence of virulence or lysogeny genes), among others. In this study, we characterized bacteriophage Phab24, which infects a colistin-resistant strain of the notorious nosocomial pathogen Acinetobacter baumannii.

36640263	Detection of multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii from burn patients and healthcare workers in Iran.	Multidrug-resistant (MDR) Acinetobacter baumannii is a serious global health threat. Burn patients are at high risk to acquire A. baumannii infections from endogenous sources. This study evaluated carbapenem resistance and clonal relatedness of A. baumannii isolated from burn patients and healthcare workers (HCWs).The study was performed in 100 non-duplicated A. baumannii isolates from nasal and hand samples of hospitalized burn patients and HCWs in two hospitals of Iran from June 2020 to August 2021. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed and carbapenemase genes were detected by PCR. Clonal relatedness of A. baumannii isolates was determined by two single-locus sequence-based typing of blaOXA-51-like and ampC and by multilocus sequence typing (MLST).All A. baumannii isolates were found to be MDR while susceptible to colistin. The intI1, conserved segments of class 1 integron (intI1 CS), blaIMP, blaVIM, blaOXA-51-like, and blaOXA-23-like, genes were detected in 32.5%, 29.1%, 36%, 95.3%, 100%, 100%; and 14.3%, 14.3%, 21.4%, 92.9%, 100%, and 85.7% of isolates from patients and from healthcare workers, respectively. The blaOXA-58, and blaOXA-143 were not detected among the isolates. Using dual-locus blaOXA-51-like and ampC sequence-based typing (SBT), the isolates obtained from nasal samples of burn patients were grouped into 3 clusters including blaOXA-317, blaADC-88 (72.1%); blaOXA-64, ampC-25 (18.6%); and blaOXA-69, ampC-1 (9.3%). While only allele type blaOXA-317, blaADC-88 was determined among isolates from HCWs. MLST results showed A. baumannii ST136, ST25, and ST1 from burn patients. However, A. baumannii strains from HCWs belonged to ST136. Our findings indicate high prevalence of globally spreading of MDR A. baumannii ST136 carrying blaOXA-23-like from nasal and hand samples of burn patients and HCWs.	2023 Mar	Farzaneh Firoozeh, Fatemeh Bakhshi, Masoud Dadashi, Farzad Badmasti, Mohammad Zibaei, Narges Omidinia	Acta Microbiol Immunol Hung

34196126	Bacteriophage therapeutics to confront multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii - a global health menace.	We have already entered the post-antibiotic era as the outbreaks of numerous multidrug-resistant strains in the community as well as hospital-acquired infections are ringing alarm bells in the health sector. Acinetobacter baumannii is one such pathogen that has been considered a worldwide threat as it acquires multidrug resistance. It is one of the most challenging hospital-acquired pathogens as World Health Organization has listed carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii as a critical priority pathogen with limited therapeutic options. There is an urgent need to develop novel strategies against such pathogens to tackle the global crisis. Bacteriophages (phages), especially the lytic ones have re-emerged as a potential therapeutic approach. This review encompasses vast majority of phages against A. baumannii strains with special references related to single phage or monophage therapy, use of phage cocktails, combination therapy with antibiotics, use of phage-derived enzymes like endolysins and depolymerases to combat the pathogen and explore their therapeutic aspects. The concurrent ecological as well as evolutionary interplay between the phages and host bacteria demands in depth-research and knowledge, so as to utilize the maximum potential of the bacteriophage therapy.	2022 Jun	Sandhya Rai, Amod Kumar	Environ Microbiol Rep
36289955	Gastrointestinal Colonization of Carbapenem-Resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>: What Is the Implication for Infection Control?	The epidemiology of patients with gastrointestinal colonization of carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB) has not been systematically analyzed. We aimed to analyze the incidence, risk factors, and clinical outcomes of patients with newly identified gastrointestinal colonization of CRAB in a healthcare region in Hong Kong, where a multi-pronged screening strategy for gastrointestinal colonization of CRAB, together with other multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs), was conducted by collecting fecal specimens (rectal swab or stool) upon admission and during hospitalization. From 1 October 2015 to 31 December 2019, a total of 161,339 fecal specimens from 63,588 patients, 61,856 (97.3%) of whom were hospitalized patients, and 54,525 (88.1%) were screened upon admission, with 1309 positive for CRAB (2.4% prevalence). Among patients positive for CRAB in fecal specimens, 698 (53.3%) had newly detected gastrointestinal colonization of CRAB, giving an incidence of 10.03 per 10,000 patient admissions and constituting 2646 CRAB colonization days in the general wards. Excluding the 164 patients with co-colonization of other MDROs, 534 patients had gastrointestinal colonization with only CRAB, and 12.5% (67/534) developed symptomatic CRAB infections at a median of 61 days (range: 2 to 671 days), during prospective follow-up for 2 years. Compared with age- and sex-matched controls, patients being referred from residential care homes for the elderly, the presence of indwelling devices, use of beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitors, carbapenems, and proton pump inhibitors in the preceding 6 months, and history of hospitalization in the past 6 months were significantly associated with gastrointestinal colonization with CRAB, as shown by multivariable analysis. Log-rank test showed that cases had significantly shorter survival duration than controls (p < 0.001). The adjusted hazard ratio of gastrointestinal colonization of CRAB was 1.8 (95% CI: 1.5−2.2; p < 0.001), as shown by Cox regression analysis. Whole-genome sequencing of eight patients with CRAB isolates in their blood cultures and rectal swabs during the same episode of hospitalization revealed ST-195 as the predominant type, as shown by multilocus sequencing type. Gastrointestinal colonization of CRAB poses a considerable challenge for infection prevention and control.	2022 Sep	Shuk-Ching Wong, Jonathan Hon-Kwan Chen, Pui-Hing Chau, Simon Yung-Chun So, Christine Ho-Yan AuYeung, Lithia Lai-Ha Yuen, Veronica Wing-Man Chan, Germaine Kit-Ming Lam, Kelvin Hei-Yeung Chiu, Pak-Leung Ho, Janice Yee-Chi Lo, Kwok-Yung Yuen, Vincent Chi-Chung Cheng	Antibiotics (Basel)
35884146	Clinical Features and Outcomes of Monobacterial and Polybacterial Episodes of Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia Due to Multidrug-Resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>.	Multidrug-resistant A. baumannii (MDRAB) VAP has high morbidity and mortality, and the rates are constantly increasing globally. Mono- and polybacterial MDRAB VAP might differ, including outcomes. We conducted a single-center, retrospective (January 2014−December 2016) study in the four ICUs (12−18−24 beds each) of a reference Lithuanian university hospital, aiming to compare the clinical features and the 30-day mortality of monobacterial and polybacterial MDRAB VAP episodes. A total of 156 MDRAB VAP episodes were analyzed: 105 (67.5%) were monomicrobial. The 30-day mortality was higher (p < 0.05) in monobacterial episodes: overall (57.1 vs. 37.3%), subgroup with appropriate antibiotic therapy (50.7 vs. 23.5%), and subgroup of XDR A. baumannii (57.3 vs. 36.4%). Monobacterial MDRAB VAP was associated (p < 0.05) with Charlson comorbidity index ≥3 (67.6 vs. 47.1%), respiratory comorbidities (19.0 vs. 5.9%), obesity (27.6 vs. 9.8%), prior hospitalization (58.1 vs. 31.4%), prior antibiotic therapy (99.0 vs. 92.2%), sepsis (88.6 vs. 76.5%), septic shock (51.9 vs. 34.6%), severe hypoxemia (23.8 vs. 7.8%), higher leukocyte count on VAP onset (median [IQR] 11.6 [8.4−16.6] vs. 10.9 [7.3−13.4]), and RRT need during ICU stay (37.1 vs. 17.6%). Patients with polybacterial VAP had a higher frequency of decreased level of consciousness (p < 0.05) on ICU admission (29.4 vs. 14.3%) and on VAP onset (29.4 vs. 11.4%). We concluded that monobacterial MDRAB VAP had different demographic/clinical characteristics compared to polybacterial and carried worse outcomes. These important findings need to be validated in a larger, prospective study, and the management implications to be further investigated.	2022 Jul	Dalia Adukauskiene, Ausra Ciginskiene, Agne Adukauskaite, Despoina Koulenti, Jordi Rello	Antibiotics (Basel)
35859248	Enhancing thermal stability and lytic activity of phage lysin PlyAB1 from Acinetobacter baumannii.	With the increasingly serious drug resistance of Acinetobacter baumannii, there is an increasingly urgent need for new antibacterial drugs. Phage lysin PlyAB1 has a bactericidal effect on drug-resistant A. baumannii, which has the potential to replace antibiotics to fight infection caused by A. baumannii. However, its application is limited by its thermal stability and lytic activity. To solve these problems, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations combined with Hotspot wizard 3.0 were used to identify key residue sites affecting thermal stability, and evolutionary analysis combined with multiple sequence alignment was used to identify key residue sites affecting lytic activity. Four single-point variants with significantly increased thermal stability and four single-point variants with significantly lytic activity were obtained, respectively. Furthermore, by superimposing mutations, we obtained three double-point variants, G100Q/K69R, G100R/K69R, and G100K/K69R, with significantly improved thermal stability and improved lytic activity. At 45°C, the lytic activity and half-life of the optimal variant G100Q/K69R were 1.51- and 24-fold higher than those of the wild PlyAB1, respectively. These results deepen our understanding of the structure and function of phage lysin and contribute to the application of phage lysin in antibiotic substitution.	2022 Oct	Yingbo Yuan, Qingbin Li, Shuhang Zhang, Jinhong Gu, Guangtao Huang, Qingsheng Qi, Xuemei Lu	Biotechnol Bioeng

36136497	Biodegradation of Dibutyl Phthalate by the New Strain <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> DP-2.	Optimizing the culture conditions of DBP degradation by bacteria and investigating its biodegradation pathways have a great importance to develop effective PAEs pollution control strategies. In this study, we investigated the cultivation condition optimization, degradation kinetics, and degradation pathways of a newly isolated dibutyl phthalate (DBP) degradation strain, which was isolated from activated sludge and identified as <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> DP-2 via morphological observation, biochemical identification, and 16S rDNA sequence analysis. The degradation conditions were optimized based on the results of single-factor experiments and response surface optimization experiments. The DBP degradation rate of <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> DP-2 reached up to 85.86% when the inoculation amount was 17.14%, the DBP concentration was 9.81 mg·L<sup>-1</sup> and the NaCl concentration was 5 g·L<sup>-1</sup>. The GC-MS analysis results indicated that the intermediate metabolites of <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> DP-2 mainly consisted of DMP, MBP, PA, and benzoic acid derivatives, which confirmed the degradation pathway from DBP to PA under aerobic pathway and then to BA under anaerobic pathway. In summary, <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> DP-2 shows great potential for the degradation of DBP in contaminated soils.	2022 Sep	Cheng Li, Chunjing Liu, Rongzhen Li, Yue Liu, Jianzhi Xie, Bowen Li	Toxics

36299724	Cinnamon essential oil and its emulsion as efficient antibiofilm agents to combat <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>.	<i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> is an emerging nosocomial pathogen resistant to a wide spectrum of antibiotics, with great potential to form a biofilm, which further aggravates treatment of infections caused by it. Therefore, searching for new potent agents that are efficient against <i>A. baumannii</i> seems to be a necessity. One of them, which has already been proven to possess a wide spectrum of biological activities, including antimicrobial effect, is cinnamon essential oil. Still, further increase of antibacterial efficacy and improvement of bioavailability of cinnamon oil is possible by emulsification process. The aim of this study was comparative analysis of cinnamon essential oil and its emulsion against biofilm forming <i>A. baumannii</i> clinical isolates. Furthermore, the investigation of toxicological aspects of possible applications of essential oil and emulsion was done as well. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry of essential oil indicated <i>trans</i>-cinnamaldehyde as the most abundant component. The cinnamon emulsion was synthesized from cinnamon essential oil by combining modified low- and high- energy methods. Synthesized emulsion was characterized with Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and photon correlation spectroscopy. Both substances exhibited significant antibacterial (minimal inhibitory concentrations in the range 0.125-0.5 mg/ml) and antibiofilm effects (inhibitions of formation and reduction of pre-formed biofilm were 47-81 and 30-62%, respectively). Compared to essential oil, the efficacy of emulsion was even stronger considering the small share of pure oil (20%) in the emulsion. The result of biofilm eradication assay was confirmed by scanning electron microscopy. Even though the cytotoxicity was high especially for the emulsion, genotoxicity was not determined. In conclusion, strong antibacterial/antibiofilm effect against <i>A. baumannii</i> of the cinnamon essential oil and the fact that emulsification even potentiated the activity, seems to be of great significance. Observed cytotoxicity implicated that further analysis is needed in order to clearly determine active principles being responsible for obtained antibacterial/antibiofilm and cytotoxic properties.	2022	Tea Ganić, Stefana Vuletić, Biljana Nikolić, Magdalena Stevanović, Maja Kuzmanović, Dušan Kekić, Saša Đurović, Stefana Cvetković, Dragana Mitić-Ćulafić	Front Microbiol

36191015	Ecofriendly phytosynthesized zirconium oxide nanoparticles as antibiofilm and quorum quenching agents against <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>.	The worldwide increase of multi-drug resistance has directed the researchers to focus on ecofriendly ways of nanoparticles synthesis with effective antivirulence properties. Here, we report the antibiofilm and quorum quenching (QQ) potential of zirconium oxide nanoparticles (ZrO<sub>2</sub> NPs) synthesized from aqueous ginger extract against multi-drug resistant (MDR) <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>. The results indicated that ZrO<sub>2</sub> NPs were of tetragonal shape with average diameter of 16 nm. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) values for <i>A. baumannii</i> were 15.6 and 62.5 µg/ml, respectively, as revealed by broth microdilution assay. Exposure of bacterial cells to ZrO<sub>2</sub> NPs resulted in reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation which in turn led to cellular membrane disruption as observed by an increase in leakage of cellular contents, such as proteins, sugars, and DNA. The antibiofilm activity was evaluated by microtiter plate assay and the results revealed that the percentage inhibition of biofilm was found to be 14.3-80.6%. ZrO<sub>2</sub> NPs also obstructed the chemical composition of biofilms matrix by reducing the proteins and carbohydrate contents. Molecular docking studies of ZrO<sub>2</sub> NPs with four proteins (2NAZ, 4HKG, 5D6H, and 5HM6) involved in biofilm formation of <i>A. baumannii</i> revealed the interaction of zirconium with target proteins. These findings suggested the <i>in vitro</i> efficacy of phytosynthesized ZrO<sub>2</sub> NPs as antibiofilm and QQ agents that can be exploited in the development of alternative therapeutic options against MDR <i>A. baumannii</i>.	2022 Sep	Muhammad Hussnain Siddique, Sumreen Hayat, Saima Muzammil, Asma Ashraf, Arif Muhammad Khan, Muhammad Umar Ijaz, Mohsin Khurshid, Muhammad Afzal	Drug Dev Ind Pharm

36968113	Deciphering the virulence factors, regulation, and immune response to <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> infection.	Deciphering the virulence factors, regulation, and immune response to <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> infection<i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> is a gram-negative multidrug-resistant nosocomial pathogen and a major cause of hospital acquired infetions. Carbapenem resistant <i>A. baumannii</i> has been categorised as a Priority1 critial pathogen by the World Health Organisation. <i>A. baumannii</i> is responsible for infections in hospital settings, clinical sectors, ventilator-associated pneumonia, and bloodstream infections with a mortality rates up to 35%. With the development of advanced genome sequencing, molecular mechanisms of manipulating bacterial genomes, and animal infection studies, it has become more convenient to identify the factors that play a major role in <i>A. baumannii</i> infection and its persistence. In the present review, we have explored the mechanism of infection, virulence factors, and various other factors associated with the pathogenesis of this organism. Additionally, the role of the innate and adaptive immune response, and the current progress in the development of innovative strategies to combat this multidrug-resistant pathogen is also discussed.	2023	Afreen Shadan, Avik Pathak, Ying Ma, Ranjana Pathania, Rajnish Prakash Singh	Front Cell Infect Microbiol

35644510	The role of Acinetobacter baumannii CarO outer membrane protein in carbapenems influx.	The gram-negative strain Acinetobacter baumannii is a cocobacillus, non-motile and aerobic organism that is often found in nosocomial infections. Many institutions worldwide such as WHO are grappling with antibiotic resistance A. baumannii. Therefore, in recent years, there have been many studies in the literature about antibiotic resistance mechanisms. We studied the specificity of carbapenems for CarO, an outer membrane protein associated with imipenem-resistance that was strongly related to a decrease in CarO expression level or changes in protein structure. The specificity of five different carbapenems, imipenem, biapenem, ertapenem, faropenem, and meropenem, against the A. baumannii ATCC-17978 CarO protein, as well as the specificity of imipenem for five different types Type-1, Type-2, Type-3, Type-4, and ATCC-17978 CarO protein, were investigated using computational methods. In this study, homology modeling, molecular docking, membrane-protein complex building, and 800 ns long MD simulation methods were followed. The interactions of imipenem with the extracellular region of five different forms of CarO protein were investigated in this study, as well as five different antibiotic binding profiles to the model organism ATCC-17978 CarO protein. The mechanism of CarO influx has been revealed with this study at the molecular level and this data is intended to be used in future research, mutagenesis, and clinical trials.	2022	Emrah Sariyer	Res Microbiol

36625573	Acinetobacter baumannii Kills Fungi via a Type VI DNase Effector.	Many Gram-negative bacteria deploy a type VI secretion system (T6SS) to inject toxins into target cells to promote their survival and replication in complex environments. Here, we report that Acinetobacter baumannii uses its T6SS to kill fungi and that the effector TafE (<i>ACX60_15365</i>) is responsible for such killing. Although ectopically expressed TafE is toxic to both Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, deletion of <i>tafE</i> only affects the antifungal activity of A. baumannii. We demonstrate that TafE is a DNase capable of targeting the nuclei of yeast cells and that an Ntox15 domain is essential for its ability to degrade DNA. Furthermore, our findings show that A. baumannii is protected from the toxicity of TafE by elaborating the immunity protein TaeI (<i>ACX60_15360</i>), which antagonizes the activity of the effector by direct binding. The discovery of A. baumannii T6SS effectors capable of killing multiple taxonomically distinct microbes has shed light on a mechanism of the high-level fitness of this pathogen in environments characterized by scarce nutrients and the potential presence of diverse microorganisms. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Acinetobacter baumannii is an increasing important nosocomial pathogen that is difficult to combat due to its ability to survive in harsh environments and the emergence of isolates that are resistant to multiple antibiotics. A better understanding of the mechanism underlying the toughness of A. baumannii may identify its Achilles' heel, which will facilitate the development of novel preventive and treatment measures. In this study, our findings show that A. baumannii kills fungi with the DNase effector TafE injected into competitor cells by its type VI secretion system. A. baumannii is protected from the activity of TafE by the immunity protein TaeI, which inactivates the effector by direct binding. Our results suggest that inactivation of its T6SS or effectors may reduce the fitness of A. baumannii and increase the effectiveness of treatment by means such as antibiotics. Furthermore, our finding suggests that targeted degradation of TaeI may be an effective strategy to kill A. baumannii.	2023 Feb	Jingjing Luo, Xiao Chu, Jing Jie, Yu Sun, Qingtian Guan, Dan Li, Zhao-Qing Luo, Lei Song	mBio
36009914	Genomic Analysis of <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> Isolates Carrying OXA-23 and OXA-58 Genes from Animals Reveals ST1 and ST25 as Major Clonal Lineages.	<i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> is increasingly being recognized as a relevant pathogen for animals with a putative zoonotic impact. This study aimed at identifying and characterizing carbapenemase-producing <i>A. baumannii</i> from animals. Among 503 <i>A. baumannii</i>, mainly isolated from dogs/cats (75.7%) between 2013 and 2018, 42 isolates from 22 veterinary clinics (VCs) harboured <i>bla</i><sub>OXA-58</sub> (<i>n</i> = 29) or <i>bla</i><sub>OXA-23</sub> (<i>n</i> = 13). The <i>bla</i><sub>OXA-58</sub> gene was located on plasmids (11.4-21.1 kb) within different genetic surroundings (patterns A-D). <i>Bla</i><sub>OXA-23</sub> was embedded in Tn<i>2006</i> on the chromosome (<i>n</i> = 4; pattern a) or Tn<i>2008</i> on plasmids (<i>n</i> = 9; 41.2-71.3 kb; patterns b-e). The predominant IC1-ST1<sup>P</sup>-OXA-58 (66.7%; 96.4% cgMLST complex type (CT)-1808) was disseminated among 11 VCs in Germany. Resistance islands <i>Aba</i>R3-like (<i>n</i> = 15) and <i>Aba</i>R10 (<i>n</i> = 1) have emerged among ST1-isolates since 2016. IC7-ST25<sup>P</sup>-OXA-23 isolates (21.4%) occurred in seven VCs in Germany, France and Italy and differed in their resistance gene patterns from those of OXA-58 isolates. They were separated into six CTs, basically according to their regional origin. Other STs observed were ST10, ST578 and ST602. In conclusion, OXA-23 and OXA-58 were linked with ST1 and ST25, two globally distributed lineages in humans. The suggested transmission of certain lineages within and among VCs together with the acquisition of <i>Aba</i>R islands hints at a successful dissemination of multidrug-resistant strains in the VC environment.	2022 Aug	Lisa Jacobmeyer, Torsten Semmler, Ivonne Stamm, Christa Ewers	Antibiotics (Basel)
36360551	Molecular Characterization and Antibiogram of <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> Clinical Isolates Recovered from the Patients with Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia.	A 2-year prospective study carried out on ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) patients in the intensive care unit at a tertiary care hospital, Hail, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), revealed a high prevalence of extremely drug-resistant (XDR) <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>. About a 9% increase in the incidence rate of <i>A. baumannii</i> occurred in the VAP patients between 2019 and 2020 (21.4% to 30.7%). In 2019, the isolates were positive for IMP-1 and VIM-2 (31.1% and 25.7%, respectively) as detected by PCR. In comparison, a higher proportion of isolates produced NDM-1 in 2020. Here, we observed a high proportion of resistant ICU isolates towards the most common antibiotics in use. Colistin sensitivity dropped to 91.4% in the year 2020 as compared to 2019 (100%). Thus, the finding of this study has a highly significant clinical implementation in the clinical management strategies for VAP patients. Furthermore, strict implementation of antibiotic stewardship policies, regular surveillance programs for antimicrobial resistance monitoring, and screening for genes encoding drug resistance phenotypes have become imperative.	2022 Nov	Mohd Saleem, Azharuddin Sajid Syed Khaja, Ashfaque Hossain, Fahaad Alenazi, Kamaleldin B Said, Soha Abdallah Moursi, Homoud Abdulmohsin Almalaq, Hamza Mohamed, Ehab Rakha	Healthcare (Basel)
35846753	Selection and Identification of a DNA Aptamer for Multidrug-Resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> Using an In-House Cell-SELEX Methodology.	Infections caused by multidrug-resistant <i>A. baumannii</i> are a worldwide health concern with high mortality rates. Rapid identification of this infectious agent is critical as it can easily spread with difficult or no options for treatment. In this context, the development of reliable and economically viable detection and therapeutic methodologies are still challenging. One of the promising solutions is the development of nucleic acid aptamers capable of interacting with bacteria. These aptamers can be used for specific recognition of infectious agents as well as for blocking their functions. Cell-SELEX technology currently allows the selection and identification of aptamers and is flexible enough to target molecules present in an entire bacterial cell without their prior knowledge. However, the aptamer technology is still facing many challenges, such as the complexity of the screening process. Here, we describe the selection and identification of a new aptamer A01, using an in-house whole-cell SELEX-based methodology, against multi-resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>, with rapid execution and low cost. In addition, this protocol allowed the identification of the aptamer A01 with the whole <i>A. baumannii</i> cell as a target. The aptamer A01 demonstrated a binding preference to <i>A. baumannii</i> when compared to <i>K. pneumoniae</i>, <i>C. albicans</i>, and <i>S. aureus</i> in fluorescence assays. Although the time-kill assay did not show an effect on bacterial growth, the potential bactericidal or bacteriostatic cannot be totally discarded. The new categorized aptamer (A01) displayed a significant binding affinity to MDR <i>A. baumannii</i>.	2022	Marina Farrel Côrtes, Taniela Marli Bes, Beatriz Ribeiro Deo, Beatriz Barbosa Dos Anjos, Andrés Jimenez Galisteo, Ester Cerdeira Sabino, Carlos Santos, Silvia Figueiredo Costa	Front Cell Infect Microbiol

36731874	Growth of Acinetobacter baumannii impacted by iron chelation.	Acinetobacter baumannii (AB) has become multidrug-resistant (MDR) in recent years, and, currently, there are limited effective treatment options. Nutrient metals (e.g. iron) are essential to the metabolic functions of AB. This study examined the impact of iron chelation on the growth of AB in vitro and in vivo. Susceptible and MDR-AB bloodstream isolates (n = 9) were recovered from different patients between 2011 and 2018. Clonal diversity was ascertained by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy. In vitro bacterial densities were measured over 20 h to determine growth profiles. Variable amounts of a chelating agent [deferiprone (DFP)] were added to create a concentration gradient. Galleria mellonella larvae were inoculated with an isolate, with and without DFP. Quantitative culture was used to ascertain the bacterial burden of aggregate larvae immediately and 4 h post-infection. Increasing concentrations of DFP caused a transient and concentration-dependent hindrance to in vitro growth, compared to the no-treatment group. In vivo bacterial burden immediately post-infection in both groups was comparable. After 4 h, the burden was much higher in the control group comparatively (8.7 and 6.7 log CFU g-1). These results support that micro-nutrient limitation has the potential of being a novel approach for treating high-risk infections due to MDR-AB.	2023 Feb	Brianna M Eales, Bing Bai, Paul R Merlau, Vincent H Tam	Lett Appl Microbiol
35467374	Synergistic Antimicrobial Effect of Colistin in Combination with Econazole against Multidrug-Resistant Acinetobacter baumannii and Its Persisters.	Colistin is a last-line antibiotic which acts by causing membrane permeabilization in Gram-negative bacteria. However, its clinical value has been limited by its toxicity and the emergence of resistant organisms. In this study, we showed that econazole and colistin can act synergistically to produce a strong antimicrobial effect sufficient for eradication of starvation-induced tolerant and multidrug-resistant populations of Acinetobacter baumannii, a notorious pathogen causing recalcitrant infections, both <i>in vitro</i> and in mouse infection models. Investigation of the underlying mechanism showed that, while colistin disrupts the membrane structure, econazole causes the dissipation of proton motive force, eliciting a vicious cycle of membrane structural damages and disruption of membrane protein functions, and eventually cell death. This drug combination therefore achieves our goal of using a much smaller dosage of colistin to produce a much stronger antimicrobial effect to tackle the problems of toxicity and resistance associated with colistin usage. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Findings described in this study constitute concrete evidence that it is possible to significantly enhance the antimicrobial activity of colistin by using an antifungal drug, econazole, as a colistin adjuvant. We showed that this drug combination can kill not only multidrug-resistant A. baumannii but also the tolerant subpopulation of such strains known as persisters, which may cause chronic and recurrent infections in clinical settings. The synergistic killing effect of the econazole and colistin combination was also observable in mouse infection models at a very low concentration, suggesting that such a drug combination has high potential to be used clinically. Findings in this study therefore have important implications for enhancing its clinical application potential as well as developing new approaches to enhance treatment effectiveness and reduce suffering in patients.	2022 Jun	Miaomiao Xie, Kaichao Chen, Edward Wai-Chi Chan, Sheng Chen	Microbiol Spectr
35961093	One-step salting-out extraction of bacteriophage from its infection broth of Acinetobacter baumannii.	Phages as a potential alternative antibiotic for multidrug-resistant bacterial infections are receiving great attention worldwide. However, the traditional separation and purification of phage are cumbersome, time-consuming, costly and inefficient. In this study, phage phiAB9 for multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii was separated and purified by a simple and cost-saving one-step salting-out extraction (SOE). Several kinds of salts and organic solvents without effect on phage survival were chosen to form the SOE systems, and the composition of SOE systems were optimized according to the phage recovery rate and impurity removal rate. After one-step SOE by an optimal system composed of 18% (w/w) ammonium citrate and 40% (w/w) ethyl acetate, the recovery rate of phage in the middle phase could reach to 90.82%, and most proteins (99.57%), cells (97.98%) and endotoxin (84.08%) were well removed, with a concentration factor of 210 and the purification factors of phage to proteins, cells and endotoxin were 303.64, 133.55 and 5.36, respectively. Comparing with two-step SOE and traditional aqueous two-phase extraction, one-step SOE may be an available method for the separation and purification of phages.	2022 Aug	Suyang Duan, Yuesheng Dong, Yongping Xu, Jiajun Yin, Lili Geng, Zhilong Xiu	J Chromatogr A
36128545	Oxa-376 and Oxa-530 variants of β-lactamase: computational study uncovers potential therapeutic targets of <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>.	Antimicrobial resistance is a major global health crisis, resulting in thousands of deaths each year. Antibiotics' effectiveness against microorganisms deteriorates over time as multidrug resistance (MDR) develops, which is exacerbated by irregular antibiotic use, poor disease management, and the evasive nature of bacteria. The World Health Organization has recognized multidrug resistance as a critical public health concern, and <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> has been at the center of attention due to its ability to develop multidrug resistance (MDR). It generally produces carbapenem-hydrolyzing oxacillinase, which has been identified as the primary source of beta-lactam resistance in MDR bacteria. Recently, point mutations in <i>A. baumannii</i> have been identified as a key factor of multidrug resistance, making them a prime concern for researchers. The goal of the current work was to establish a unique way of finding multidrug-resistant variants and identify the most damaging mutations in the existing databases. We characterized the deleterious variants of oxacillinases using several computational tools. Following a thorough analysis, Oxa-376 and Oxa-530 were found to be more damaging when compared with the wild-type Oxa-51. The mutants' 3D structures were then prepared and refined with RaptorX, GalaxyRefine, and SAVES servers. Our research incorporates seven antimicrobial agents to illustrate the resistance capability of the variants of oxacillinase by evaluating binding affinity in Autodock-vina and Schrodinger software. RMSD, RMSF, Radius of gyration analysis, the solvent-accessible surface area (SASA), hydrogen bonding analysis and MM-GBSA from Molecular Dynamics Simulation revealed the dynamic nature and stability of wild-type and Oxa-376 and Oxa-530 variants. Our findings will benefit researchers looking for the deleterious mutations of <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> and new therapeutics to combat those variants. However, further studies are necessary to evaluate the mechanism of hydrolyzing activity and antibiotic resistance of these variants.	2022 Aug	Sajal Kumar Halder, Maria Mulla Mim, Md Meharab Hassan Alif, Jannatul Fardous Shathi, Nuhu Alam, Aparna Shil, Mahbubul Kabir Himel	RSC Adv
36649779	Characterization of the enzymatic and multifunctional properties of Acinetobacter baumannii erythrose-4-phosphate dehydrogenase (E4PDH).	Infections due to Acinetobacter baumannii (A. baumannii) are rapidly increasing worldwide and consequently therapeutic options for treatment are limited. The emergence of multi drug resistant (MDR) strains has rendered available antibiotics ineffective, necessitating the urgent discovery of new drugs and drug targets. The vitamin B6 biosynthetic pathway has been considered as a potential antibacterial drug target but it is as yet uncharacterized for A. baumannii. In the current work, we have carried out in silico and biochemical characterization of Erythrose-4-phosphate dehydrogenase (E4PDH) (EC 1.2.1.72). This enzyme catalyzes the first step in the deoxyxylulose-5-phosphate (DXP) dependent Vitamin B6 biosynthetic pathway i.e. the conversion of d-erythrose-4-phosphate (E4P) to 4-Phosphoerythronate. E4PDH also possesses an additional activity whereby it can catalyze the conversion of Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P) to 1,3 bisphosphoglycerate (1,3BPG). Our studies have revealed that this enzyme exhibits an alternate moonlighting function as a cell surface receptor for the human iron transport proteins transferrin (Tf) and lactoferrin (Lf). The present work reports the internalization of Tf and consequent iron acquisition as an alternate strategy for iron acquisition. Given its essential role in two crucial pathways i.e. metabolism and iron acquisition, A. baumannii E4PDH may play a vital role in bacterial pathogenesis.	2023 Feb	Ramesh Nimma, Ajay Kumar, Zahid Gani, Anuj Gahlawat, Rahul Dilawari, Rajesh Kumar Rohilla, Hemangi Kumbhar, Prabha Garg, Sidharth Chopra, Manoj Raje, Chaaya Iyengar Raje	Microb Pathog
35946816	Description of a Rare Pyomelanin-Producing Carbapenem-Resistant Acinetobacter baumannii Strain Coharboring Chromosomal OXA-23 and NDM-1.	Carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB), which belonged to global clones 1 (GC1) or 2 (GC2), has been widely reported and become a global threat. However, non-GC1 and non-GC2 CRAB strains are not well-studied, especially for those with rare phenotype. Here, one pyomelanin-producing CRAB strain (A. baumannii DETAB-R21) was isolated from oral swab in the ICU. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing showed it was resistant to carbapenems, ceftazidime, levofloxacin, and ciprofloxacin. DETAB-R21 was ST164<sub>Pas</sub> and ST1418<sub>Oxf</sub> with KL47 and OCL5, respectively. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) analysis revealed chromosome contained three copies of <i>bla</i><sub>OXA-23</sub> on three 4,805-bp Tn<i>2006</i> composite transposons with various novel 9-bp target site duplications (TSD). A Tn<i>125</i>-like structure, including <i>bla</i><sub>NDM-1</sub>, a novel 4,343 bp composite transposon encoding <i>bla</i><sub>CARB-16,</sub> and three prophage regions were also identified. Importantly, <i>hmgA</i> was interrupted by a Tn<i>2006</i> and contributed to pyomelanin production and further confirmed by <i>hmgA</i> overexpression. Furthermore, A. baumannii irradiated with UV light, DETAB-R21 showed a higher relatively survival rate compared to a control strain that did not produce pyomelanin. No effects of pyomelanin were observed on disinfectants susceptibility, growth, or virulence. In conclusion, pyomelanin-producing CRAB carrying the <i>bla</i><sub>NDM-1</sub> and <i>bla</i><sub>OXA-23</sub> genes embedded in the bacterial chromosome is of grave concern for health care settings, highlighting the need for effective measures to prevent further dissemination. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Pyomelanin production is a quite rare phenotype in A. baumannii. Moreover, the mechanisms leading to the pyomelanin production was still unclear. Here, we for the first time, confirmed the mechanism of pyomelanin production, and further investigated the impact of pyomelanin on disinfectants susceptibility, growth, virulence, and UV irradiation. More importantly, many mobile genetic elements (MGEs), including three copies of Tn<i>2006</i> composite transposons, one copy of <i>bla</i><sub>NDM-1</sub> on the Tn<i>125</i>-like structure and three prophage regions, were identified in the chromosome, demonstrated strong plasticity of A. baumannii genome. Our study provides important insights into the new rare ST164<sub>Pas</sub> A. baumannii strain with high level carbapenem resistance, which is of great threat for patients. These findings will provide important insights into the resistance gene transfer via transposition events and further spread in the clinic.	2022 Aug	Feng Zhao, Haiyang Liu, Yue Yao, Linghong Zhang, Zhihui Zhou, Sebastian Leptihn, Yunsong Yu, Xiaoting Hua, Ying Fu	Microbiol Spectr
34967505	Mechanism of transcription regulation by Acinetobacter baumannii HpaR in the catabolism of p-hydroxyphenylacetate.	HpaR is a transcription regulator in the MarR family that controls the expression of the gene cluster responsible for conversion of p-hydroxyphenylacetate to pyruvate and succinate for cellular metabolism. Here, we report the biochemical and structural characterization of Acinetobacter baumannii HpaR (AbHpaR) and its complex with cognate DNA. Our study revealed that AbHpaR binds upstream of the divergently transcribed hpaA gene and the meta-cleavage operon, as well as the hpaR gene, thereby repressing their transcription by blocking access of RNA polymerase. Structural analysis of AbHpaR-DNA complex revealed that the DNA binding specificity can be achieved via a combination of both direct and indirect DNA sequence readouts. DNA binding of AbHpaR is weakened by 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetate (DHPA), which is the substrate of the meta-cleavage reactions; this likely leads to expression of the target genes. Based on our findings, we propose a model for how A. baumannii controls transcription of HPA-metabolizing genes, which highlights the independence of global catabolite repression and could be beneficial for metabolic engineering toward bioremediation applications. DATABASES: The structural data that support these findings are openly available in the wwPDB at https://doi.org/10.2210/pdb7EL2/pdb and https://doi.org/10.2210/pdb7EL3/pdb for AbHpaR and AbHpaR-DNA complex, respectively.	2022 Jun	Permkun Permsirivisarn, Anan Yuenyao, Nuttawan Pramanpol, Ratana Charoenwattanasatien, Wipa Suginta, Pimchai Chaiyen, Danaya Pakotiprapha	FEBS J
35884124	In Silico Docking, Resistance Modulation and Biofilm Gene Expression in Multidrug-Resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> via Cinnamic and Gallic Acids.	Despite the mounting global burden of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), the generation of new classes of effective antimicrobials still lags far behind. The interplay between multidrug resistance and biofilm formation in Acinetobacter baumannii has drastically narrowed the available therapeutic choices. The use of natural compounds holds promise as an alternate option for restoring the activity of existing antibiotics and attenuating virulence traits through reduced biofilm formation. This study aimed to evaluate the modulatory effect of combining cinnamic and gallic acids at ½MIC with various antibiotics against multidrug-resistant (MDR) A. baumannii clinical isolates as well as study the effect on the expression of the biofilm-associated genes (bap, csuE, ompA) via quantitative, real-time PCR. Combining cinnamic or gallic acid with imipenem, amikacin or doxycycline resulted in significant reduction of resistance (p < 0.05). On the contrary, no effect was recorded when both acids were combined with levofloxacin, and only cinnamic acid had a synergistic effect with colistin. The transcriptomic changes of biofilm-related genes in the presence of gallic acid at ½MIC were compared with untreated control samples. The fold expression values proved that gallic acid substantially down-regulated the respective genes in all five strong biofilm formers. Molecular docking studies of gallic and cinnamic acids on target genes revealed good binding affinities and verified the proposed mechanism of action. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the effect of gallic acid on the expression of bap, csuE and ompA genes in A. baumannii, which may permit its use as an adjunct anti-virulence therapeutic strategy.	2022 Jun	Neveen A Abdelaziz, Walid F Elkhatib, Mahmoud M Sherif, Mohammed A S Abourehab, Sara T Al-Rashood, Wagdy M Eldehna, Nada M Mostafa, Nooran S Elleboudy	Antibiotics (Basel)
35378360	High-resolution crystal structure of Acinetobacter baumannii thioredoxin 1.	Thioredoxin (Trx) is a central component of the redox control system that maintains the redox homeostasis critical for organism survival. Owing to its central role in survival, Trx is a prospective target for novel antimicrobial agents. Herein, we report a 1.45 Å high-resolution structure of Trx1 of Acinetobacter baumannii (abTrx1), an antibiotic-resistant pathogenic superbug. Although abTrx1 exhibited the canonical Trx fold, which consists of a four-stranded β-sheet surrounded by four α-helices, structural differences were detected in the loop forming the C-X-X-C redox center and the C-terminal. The unique CAPC sequence of the C-X-X-C motif in the abTrx1 redox center was characterized by mutagenesis. This study contributes to the field of drug designing against superbugs.	2022 Jun	Ye Ji Chang, Hyun Ho Park	Biochem Biophys Res Commun
35884089	Molecular Characterization of Carbapenem-Resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> Isolated from Intensive Care Unit Patients in Jordanian Hospitals.	<i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> is a common cause of healthcare-associated infections (HAI) worldwide, mostly occurring in intensive care units (ICUs). Extended-spectrum beta lactamases (ESBL)-positive <i>A. baumannii</i> strains have emerged as highly resistant to most currently used antimicrobial agents, including carbapenems. The most common mechanism for carbapenem resistance in this species is β-lactamase-mediated resistance. Carbapenem-hydrolyzing class D oxacillinases are widespread among multidrug-resistant (MDR) <i>A. baumannii</i> strains. The present study was conducted to determine the presence and distribution of <i>bla<sub>OXA</sub></i> genes among multidrug-resistant <i>A. baumannii</i> isolated from ICU patients and genes encoding insertion sequence (IS-1) in these isolates. Additionally, the plasmid DNA profiles of these isolates were determined. A total of 120 clinical isolates of <i>A. baumannii</i> from various ICU clinical specimens of four main Jordanian hospitals were collected. Bacterial isolate identification was confirmed by biochemical testing and antibiotic sensitivity was then assessed. PCR amplification and automated sequencing were carried out to detect the presence of <i>bla</i><sub>OXA-51</sub>, <i>bla</i><sub>OXA-23</sub>, <i>bla</i><sub>OXA-24</sub>, and <i>bla</i><sub>OXA-58</sub> genes, and IS<i>Aba1</i> insertion sequence. Out of the 120 <i>A. baumannii</i> isolates, 95% of the isolates were resistant to three or more classes of the antibiotics tested and were identified as MDR. The most frequent resistance of the isolates was against piperacillin (96.7%), cephalosporins (97.5%), and β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combinations antibiotics (95.8%). There were 24 (20%) ESBL-producing isolates. A co-existence of <i>bla</i><sub>OXA-51</sub> gene and IS<i>Aba1</i> in all the 24 ESBL-producing isolates was determined. In addition, in the 24 ESBL-producing isolates, 21 (87.5%) carried <i>bla</i><sub>OXA-51</sub> and <i>bla</i><sub>OXA-23</sub> genes, 1 (4.2%) carried <i>bla</i><sub>OXA-51</sub> and <i>bla</i><sub>OXA-24</sub>, but all were negative for the <i>bla</i><sub>OXA-58</sub> gene. Plasmid DNA profile A and profile B were the most common (29%) in ESBL-positive MDR <i>A. baumannii</i> isolates while plasmid DNA profile A was the most common in the ESBL-negative isolates. In conclusion, there was an increase in prevalence of MDR-<i>A. baumannii</i> in ICU wards in Jordanian hospitals, especially those having an ESBL phenotype. Thus, identification of ESBL genes is necessary for the surveillance of their transmission in hospitals.	2022 Jun	Suhaila A Al-Sheboul, Salam Z Al-Moghrabi, Yasemin Shboul, Farah Atawneh, Ahmed H Sharie, Laila F Nimri	Antibiotics (Basel)
36290038	Fitness Costs of Tigecycline Resistance in <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> and the Resistance Mechanism Revealed by a Transposon Mutation Library.	<i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> is one of the main pathogens causing nosocomial and community-acquired infections. Tigecycline is an important antibiotic for the treatment of multidrug-resistant <i>A. baumannii</i> infections, but strains resistant to tigecycline have also emerged. There are still many unclear questions concerning the mechanism of tigecycline resistance in <i>A. baumannii</i>. In this study, tigecycline-susceptible and tigecycline-intermediate strains were gradually cultured with sub-minimum inhibitory concentrations of tigecycline to select for tigecycline-resistant mutants, and a tigecycline-resistant strain was cultured under 42 °C to select for tigecycline-susceptible mutants. We found that the acquisition of tigecycline resistance affected the susceptibility of the strains to other antibiotics. Resistance to ampicillin-sulbactam is negatively correlated with tigecycline resistance. The strains will experience fitness costs along with the acquisition of tigecycline resistance. Tigecycline resistance in the strains was not related to 16S rRNA target variation or outer membrane integrity alteration. By constructing a transposon mutation library, we found that transposon insertion of the <i>adeL</i> gene reduced the sensitivity of <i>A. baumannii</i> to tigecycline. This study provides important clues for understanding the mechanism of tigecycline resistance in <i>A. baumannii</i>.	2022 Oct	Ping Wang, Hongou Wang, Cunwei Liu, Chengjie Feng, Qinghui Lu, Qinghua Zou	Antibiotics (Basel)
35638783	Origin, Phylogeny, and Transmission of the Epidemic Clone ST208 of Carbapenem-Resistant Acinetobacter baumannii on a Global Scale.	Carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB) is an opportunistic pathogen that has become a global threat. The dissemination of global clone 2 (GC2) CRAB has been well documented. Oxford sequence type (ST) 208 is one of the most prevalent lineages of A. baumannii GC2; however, its evolution and phylogeny are unclear. We collected 45 representative ST208 isolates from 14 cities in China between 1999 and 2018. Moreover, 411 ST208 genome sequences were downloaded from the GenBank database for comparison. The global ST208 phylogeny showed that ST208 might have originated from North America and subsequently evolved into two clades. Notably, the widespread OXA-23-producing ST208 A. baumannii was correlated with the transposon structure and dynamics of replicative transposition, and the Tn<i>2009</i> tandem structure of five copies of <i>bla</i><sub>OXA-23</sub> and potential circular intermediate of Tn<i>2009</i> were first detected. Furthermore, 15 Chinese ST208 isolates carried GR25 pABTJ1-like plasmids, which contained <i>bla</i><sub>OXA-23</sub> and have only been found in China in the last decade. In conclusion, our work suggests that replicative transposition contributes to the evolution and transmission of OXA-23-producing ST208 A. baumannii and highlights the new challenges posed by the epidemiological surveillance of globally distributed clonal groups via whole genome sequencing. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> ST208 as one of the most prevalent lineages of CRAB has caused several difficult-to-treat infections and outbreaks around the world. However, few studies have focused on evaluating the genetic background differences of ST208 A. baumannii isolated from very distant geographic regions. A comprehensive genomic analysis of 456 clinical strains of ST208 A. baumannii from a wide temporal and geographic range was performed in this study. Moreover, the mechanisms leading to the horizontal transfer of <i>bla</i><sub>OXA-23</sub> in ST208 A. baumannii are poorly understood. We first describe experimental evidence of the potential circular intermediate of Tn<i>2009</i>, and the Tn<i>2009</i> tandem structure of five copies of <i>bla</i><sub>OXA-23</sub> was first detected. The interbacterial transfer of genetic elements carrying resistance to last-line antibiotic carbapenems highlights the essential need to enhance epidemiologic surveillance.	2022 Jun	Yue Gao, Henan Li, Hongbin Chen, Jiangang Zhang, Ruobing Wang, Zhiren Wang, Hui Wang	Microbiol Spectr
35535800	Na<sup>+</sup> homeostasis in Acinetobacter baumannii is facilitated via the activity of the Mrp antiporter.	The human opportunistic pathogen Acinetobacter baumannii is a global threat to healthcare institutions worldwide, since it developed very efficient strategies to evade host defence and to adapt to the different environmental conditions of the host. This work focused on the importance of Na<sup>+</sup> homeostasis in A. baumannii with regards to pathobiological aspects. In silico studies revealed a homologue of a multicomponent Na<sup>+</sup> /H<sup>+</sup> antiporter system. Inactivation of the Mrp antiporter through deletion of the first gene (mrpA') resulted in a mutant that was sensitive to increasing pH values. Furthermore, the strain was highly sensitive to increasing Na<sup>+</sup> and Li<sup>+</sup> concentrations. Increasing Na<sup>+</sup> sensitivity is thought to be responsible for growth impairment in human fluids. Furthermore, deletion of mrpA' is associated with energetic defects, inhibition of motility and survival under anoxic and dry conditions.	2022 Sep	Josephine Joy Hubloher, Lisa van der Sande, Volker Müller	Environ Microbiol
35561952	Bactericidal activities and action mechanism of the novel antimicrobial peptide Hylin a1 and its analog peptides against Acinetobacter baumannii infection.	We developed an antimicrobial peptide (AMP) as a candidate substance for replacing antibiotics. Previously, a novel 18-amino acid antimicrobial peptide Hylin a1 was isolated from an electro-stimulated arboreal South American frog Hypsiboas albopunctatus, and was found to demonstrate antimicrobial activity and cytotoxicity. In a recent study, the analog peptides were designed based on the parent peptide Hylin a1 to decrease toxicity and to maintain antimicrobial efficacy. The analog peptides were substituted with alanine and lysine, resulting in the formation of amphipathic α-helical structures in membrane-mimicking environments and in the induction of hydrophobic moments and net charges. Moreover, the analog peptides showed lower hemolytic effects and mammalian cell selectivity than Hylin a1. In particularly Hylin a1-11K and Hylin a1-15K exhibited broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity and anti-biofilm activity against carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii. Permeability assays indicated that analog peptides eliminated bacteria by binding to lipopolysaccharide and by disrupting the bacterial membrane. Hylin a1-11K and Hylin a1-15K reduced inflammation by suppressing pro-inflammatory cytokines expression by A. baumannii infection and effectively ameliorated carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii infection in mice. Therefore, our results suggest that the analog peptide substituted with several residues based on Hylin a1 have antibacterial and anti-inflammatory activity, and may be effective in the treatment of carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii infection.	2022 Aug	Hee Joo Park, Hee Kyoung Kang, Eunji Park, Min Kyung Kim, Yoonkyung Park	Eur J Pharm Sci
37178001	DNA modifications impact natural transformation of Acinetobacter baumannii.	Acinetobacter baumannii is a dangerous nosocomial pathogen, especially due to its ability to rapidly acquire new genetic traits, including antibiotic resistance genes (ARG). In A. baumannii, natural competence for transformation, one of the primary modes of horizontal gene transfer (HGT), is thought to contribute to ARG acquisition and has therefore been intensively studied. However, knowledge regarding the potential role of epigenetic DNA modification(s) on this process remains lacking. Here, we demonstrate that the methylome pattern of diverse A. baumannii strains differs substantially and that these epigenetic marks influence the fate of transforming DNA. Specifically, we describe a methylome-dependent phenomenon that impacts intra- and inter-species DNA exchange by the competent A. baumannii strain A118. We go on to identify and characterize an A118-specific restriction-modification (RM) system that impairs transformation when the incoming DNA lacks a specific methylation signature. Collectively, our work contributes towards a more holistic understanding of HGT in this organism and may also aid future endeavors towards tackling the spread of novel ARGs. In particular, our results suggest that DNA exchanges between bacteria that share similar epigenomes are favored and could therefore guide future research into identifying the reservoir(s) of dangerous genetic traits for this multi-drug resistant pathogen.	2023 May	Nina Vesel, Christian Iseli, Nicolas Guex, Alexandre Lemopoulos, Melanie Blokesch	Nucleic Acids Res
35707776	Molecular Detection of <i>blaOXA <sub>-type</sub></i> Carbapenemase Genes and Antimicrobial Resistance Patterns among Clinical Isolates of <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>.	<i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> is a bacterium found in most places, especially in clinics and hospitals, and an important agent of nosocomial infections. The presence of class D enzymes such as OXA-type carbapenemases in <i>A. baumannii</i> is proven to have a key function in resistance to carbapenem. The aim of the current study is to determine the <i>blaOXA <sub>-type</sub></i> carbapenemase genes and antimicrobial resistance among clinically isolated samples of <i>A. baumannii.</i> We assessed 100 clinically isolated specimens of <i>A. baumannii</i> from patients in intensive care units of educational hospitals of Hamadan, West of Iran. The <i>A. baumannii</i> isolates' susceptibility to antibiotics was performed employing disk diffusion method. Multiplex polymerase chain reaction was used to identify the <i>bla <sub>OXA-24-like</sub></i> , <i>bla <sub>OXA-23-like</sub></i> , <i>bla <sub>OXA-58-like</sub></i> , and <i>bla <sub>OXA-51-like</sub></i> genes. <i>The bla <sub>OXA-23-like</sub></i> , <i>bla <sub>OXA-24-like</sub></i> <sub>,</sub> and <i>bla <sub>OXA-58-like</sub></i> genes' prevalence were found to be 84, 58, and 3%, respectively. The highest coexistence of the genes was for <i>bla <sub>OXA-51/23</sub></i> (84%) followed by <i>bla <sub>OXA-51/24-like</sub></i> (58%). The <i>bla <sub>OXA-51/23-</sub></i> <sub>like</sub> pattern of genes is a sort of dominant gene in resistance in <i>A. baumannii</i> from Hamadan hospitals. The highest resistance to piperacillin (83%) and ciprofloxacin (81%) has been observed in positive isolates of <i>bla <sub>OXA-23-like</sub></i> . The <i>A. baumannii</i> isolates with <i>bla <sub>OXA-58-like</sub></i> genes did not show much resistance to antibiotics. Based on the results of the phylogenetic tree analysis, all isolates have shown a high degree of similarity. This study showed the high frequency of <i>OXA</i> -type carbapenemase genes among <i>A. baumannii</i> isolates from Hamadan hospitals, Iran. Thus, applying an appropriate strategy to limit the spreading of these strains and also performing new treatment regimens are necessary.	2022 Jun	Maghsoud Kafshnouchi, Marzieh Safari, Amir Khodavirdipour, Abbas Bahador, Seyed Hamid Hashemi, Mohammad Sina Alikhani, Massoud Saidijam, Mohammad Yousef Alikhani	Glob Med Genet
36985332	<i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> from Samples of Commercially Reared Turkeys: Genomic Relationships, Antimicrobial and Biocide Susceptibility.	<i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> is especially known as a cause of nosocomial infections worldwide. It shows intrinsic and acquired resistances to numerous antimicrobial agents, which can render the treatment difficult. In contrast to the situation in human medicine, there are only few studies focusing on <i>A. baumannii</i> among livestock. In this study, we have examined 643 samples from turkeys reared for meat production, including 250 environmental and 393 diagnostic samples, for the presence of <i>A. baumannii.</i> In total, 99 isolates were identified, confirmed to species level via MALDI-TOF-MS and characterised with pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. Antimicrobial and biocide susceptibility was tested by broth microdilution methods. Based on the results, 26 representative isolates were selected and subjected to whole-genome sequencing (WGS). In general, <i>A. baumannii</i> was detected at a very low prevalence, except for a high prevalence of 79.7% in chick-box-papers (n = 118) of one-day-old turkey chicks. The distributions of the minimal inhibitory concentration values were unimodal for the four biocides and for most of the antimicrobial agents tested. WGS revealed 16 Pasteur and 18 Oxford sequence types, including new ones. Core genome MLST highlighted the diversity of most isolates. In conclusion, the isolates detected were highly diverse and still susceptible to many antimicrobial agents.	2023 Mar	Anna Schmitz, Dennis Hanke, Dörte Lüschow, Stefan Schwarz, Paul G Higgins, Andrea T Feßler	Microorganisms
35614377	Eradication of drug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii by cell-penetrating peptide fused endolysin.	Antimicrobial agents targeting peptidoglycan have shown successful results in eliminating bacteria with high selective toxicity. Bacteriophage encoded endolysin as an alternative antibiotics is a peptidoglycan degrading enzyme with a low rate of resistance. Here, the engineered endolysin was developed to defeat multiple drug-resistant (MDR) Acinetobacter baumannii. First, putative endolysin PA90 was predicted by genome analysis of isolated Pseudomonas phage PBPA. The His-tagged PA90 was purified from BL21(DE3) pLysS and tested for the enzymatic activity using Gram-negative pathogens known for having a high antibiotic resistance rate including A. baumannii. Since the measured activity of PA90 was low, probably due to the outer membrane, cell-penetrating peptide (CPP) DS4.3 was introduced at the N-terminus of PA90 to aid access to its substrate. This engineered endolysin, DS-PA90, completely killed A. baumannii at 0.25 µM, at which concentration PA90 could only eliminate less than one log in CFU/ml. Additionally, DS-PA90 has tolerance to NaCl, where the ∼50% of activity could be maintained in the presence of 150 mM NaCl, and stable activity was also observed with changes in pH or temperature. Even MDR A. baumannii strains were highly susceptible to DS-PA90 treatment: five out of nine strains were entirely killed and four strains were reduced by 3-4 log in CFU/ml. Consequently, DS-PA90 could protect waxworm from A. baumannii-induced death by ∼70% for ATCC 17978 or ∼44% for MDR strain 1656-2 infection. Collectively, our data suggest that CPP-fused endolysin can be an effective antibacterial agent against Gram-negative pathogens regardless of antibiotics resistance mechanisms.	2022 Aug	Jeonghyun Lim, Jaeyeon Jang, Heejoon Myung, Miryoung Song	J Microbiol
36009945	Control of Healthcare-Associated Carbapenem-Resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> by Enhancement of Infection Control Measures.	Antimicrobial stewardship and infection control measures are equally important in the control of antimicrobial-resistant organisms. We conducted a retrospective analysis of the incidence rate of hospital-onset carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB) infection (per 1000 patient days) in the Queen Mary Hospital, a 1700-bed, university-affiliated teaching hospital, from period 1 (1 January 2007 to 31 December 2013) to period 2 (1 January 2014 to 31 December 2019), where enhanced infection control measures, including directly observed hand hygiene before meal and medication rounds to conscious patients, and the priority use of single room isolation, were implemented during period 2. This study aimed to investigate the association between enhanced infection control measures and changes in the trend in the incidence rate of hospital-onset CRAB infection. Antimicrobial consumption (defined daily dose per 1000 patient days) was monitored. Interrupted time series, in particular segmented Poisson regression, was used. The hospital-onset CRAB infection increased by 21.3% per year [relative risk (RR): 1.213, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.162−1.266, p < 0.001], whereas the consumption of the extended spectrum betalactam-betalactamase inhibitor (BLBI) combination and cephalosporins increased by 11.2% per year (RR: 1.112, 95% CI: 1.102−1.122, p < 0.001) and 4.2% per year (RR: 1.042, 95% CI: 1.028−1.056, p < 0.001), respectively, in period 1. With enhanced infection control measures, the hospital-onset CRAB infection decreased by 9.8% per year (RR: 0.902, 95% CI: 0.854−0.953, p < 0.001), whereas the consumption of the extended spectrum BLBI combination and cephalosporins increased by 3.8% per year (RR: 1.038, 95% CI: 1.033−1.044, p < 0.001) and 7.6% per year (RR: 1.076, 95% CI: 1.056−1.097, p < 0.001), respectively, in period 2. The consumption of carbapenems increased by 8.4% per year (RR: 1.84, 95% CI: 1.073−1.094, p < 0.001) in both period 1 and period 2. The control of healthcare-associated CRAB could be achieved by infection control measures with an emphasis on directly observed hand hygiene, despite an increasing trend of antimicrobial consumption.	2022 Aug	Shuk-Ching Wong, Pui-Hing Chau, Simon Yung-Chun So, Germaine Kit-Ming Lam, Veronica Wing-Man Chan, Lithia Lai-Ha Yuen, Christine Ho-Yan Au Yeung, Jonathan Hon-Kwan Chen, Pak-Leung Ho, Kwok-Yung Yuen, Vincent Chi-Chung Cheng	Antibiotics (Basel)
35750869	A rare occurrence of multidrug-resistant environmental Acinetobacter baumannii strains from the soil of Mangaluru, India.	Over the last decade, Acinetobacter baumannii has emerged as one of the main causes of infections acquired in the hospital setting. Outbreaks associated with this pathogen are caused mainly due to contamination and transmission in hospital territories. However, the natural habitats of A. baumannii of clinical significance still remain unclear. In this study, we highlight the isolation and identification of multidrug-resistant environmental strains of A. baumannii from the soil of Mangaluru city. All the recovered isolates were biofilm formers, and two isolates were multidrug-resistant and showed resistance to fluoroquinolone, aminoglycosides, sulfonamide, tetracycline, and carbapenems. In addition, they exhibited protease activity, and produced phospholipase C and siderophore. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to isolate and identify drug-resistant strains of A. baumannii from the soil.	2022 Jun	Sarika Suresh, Vankadari Aditya, Vijaya Kumar Deekshit, Radhakrishna Manipura, Ramya Premanath	Arch Microbiol
35992699	Molecular characterisation of <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> isolates from bloodstream infections in a tertiary-level hospital in South Africa.	<i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> is an opportunistic pathogen and causes various infections in patients. This study aimed to describe the clinical, epidemiological and molecular characteristics of <i>A. baumannii</i> isolated from BCs in patients at a tertiary-level hospital in South Africa. Ninety-six isolates from bloodstream infections were collected. Clinical characteristics of patients were recorded from patient files. Organism identification and AST was performed using automated systems. PCR screening for the <i>mcr-1</i> to <i>mcr</i>-5 genes was done. To infer genetic relatedness, a dendrogram was constructed using MALDI-TOF MS. All colistin-resistant isolates (<i>n</i> = 9) were selected for WGS. The patients were divided into three groups, infants (<1 year; <i>n</i> = 54), paediatrics (1-18 years; <i>n</i> = 6) and adults (≥19 years; <i>n</i> = 36) with a median age of 13 days, 1 and 41 years respectively. Of the 96 <i>A. baumannii</i> bacteraemia cases, 96.9% (93/96) were healthcare-associated. The crude mortality rate at 30 days was 52.2% (48/92). The majority of the isolates were multidrug-resistant (MDR). All isolates were PCR-negative for the <i>mcr</i>-1 to <i>mcr</i>-5 genes. The majority of the isolates belonged to cluster 1 (62/96) according to the MALDI-TOF MS dendrogram. Colistin resistance was confirmed in nine <i>A. baumannii</i> isolates (9.4%). The colistin-resistant isolates belonged to sequence type (ST) 1 (5/6) and ST2 (1/6). The majority of ST1 isolates showed low SNP diversity (≤4 SNPs). All the colistin-resistant isolates were resistant to carbapenems, exhibited an XDR phenotype and harboured the <i>bla</i> <sub><i>OXA-</i>23</sub> gene. The <i>bla</i> <sub><i>NDM</i></sub> gene was only detected in ST1 colistin-resistant isolates (<i>n</i> = 5). The <i>lps</i>B gene was detected in all colistin-resistant isolates as well as various efflux pump genes belonging to the RND, the MFS and the SMR families. The lipooligosaccharide OCL1 was detected in all colistin-resistant ST1 and ST2 isolates and the capsular polysaccharide KL3 and KL17 were detected in ST2 and ST1 respectively. This study demonstrated a 9.4% prevalence of colistin-resistant ST1 and ST2 <i>A. baumannii</i> in BC isolates. The detection of the <i>lps</i>B gene indicates a potential threat and requires close prospective monitoring.	2022	Michelle Lowe, Ashika Singh-Moodley, Husna Ismail, Teena Thomas, Vindana Chibabhai, Trusha Nana, Warren Lowman, Arshad Ismail, Wai Yin Chan, Olga Perovic	Front Microbiol
35935207	Genetic Configuration of Genomic Resistance Islands in <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> Clinical Isolates From Egypt.	In <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> (<i>A. baumannii</i>), a wide repertoire of resistance genes is often carried within genomic resistance islands (RIs), particularly in high-risk global clones (GCs). As the first in Egypt, the current study aimed at exploring the diversity and genetic configuration of RIs in the clinical isolates of <i>A. baumannii</i>. For this purpose, draft genomes of 18 isolates were generated by Illumina sequencing. Disk diffusion susceptibility profiling revealed multidrug resistance (MDR) and extensive drug resistance (XDR) phenotypes in 27.7 and 72.2%, respectively. The highest susceptibility was noted for tigecycline (100.0%) followed by colistin (94.4%), for which an MIC<sub>50</sub> of 0.25 μg/ml was recorded by the broth microdilution assay. Sequence typing (ST) showed that the majority of the isolates belonged to high-risk global clones (GC1, GC2, and GC9). A novel Oxford sequence type (ST2329) that also formed a novel clonal complex was submitted to the PubMLST database. A novel <i>bla</i> <sub>ADC</sub> variant (<i>bla</i> <sub>ADC-258</sub>) was also identified in strain M18 (ST85<sup>Pas</sup>/1089<sup>Oxf</sup>). In addition to a wide array of resistance determinants, whole-genome sequencing (WGS) disclosed at least nine configurations of genomic RIs distributed over 16/18 isolates. GC2 isolates accumulated the largest number of RIs (three RIs/isolate) followed by those that belong to GC1 (two RIs/isolate). In addition to Tn<i>6022</i> (44.4%), the <i>comM</i> gene was interrupted by AbaR4 (5.5%) and three variants of A. b<i>aumannii</i> genomic resistance island 1(AbGRI)-type RIs (44.4%), including AbaR4b (16.6%) and two novel configurations of AbGRI1-like RIs (22.2%). Three of which (AbaR4, AbaR4b, and AbGRI1-like-2) carried <i>bla</i> <sub>OXA-23</sub> within Tn<i>2006</i>. With less abundance (38.8%), IS<i>26</i>-bound RIs were detected exclusively in GC2 isolates. These included a short version of AbGRI2 (AbGRI2-15) carrying the genes <i>bla</i> <sub>TEM-1</sub> and <i>aphA1</i> and two variants of AbGRI3 RIs carrying up to seven resistance genes [<i>mphE-msrE-armA-sul1-aadA1-catB8-aacA4</i>]. Confined to GC1 (22.2%), sulfonamide resistance was acquired by an IS<i>Aba1</i> bracketed GIsul2 RI. An additional RI (RI-PER-7) was also identified on a plasmid carried by strain M03. Among others, RI-PER-7 carried the resistance genes <i>armA</i> and <i>bla</i> <sub>PER-7</sub>. Here, we provided a closer view of the diversity and genetic organization of RIs carried by a previously unexplored population of <i>A. baumannii</i>.	2022	Samira M Hamed, Amira F A Hussein, Mohamed H Al-Agamy, Hesham H Radwan, Mai M Zafer	Front Microbiol

37074067	Virulence Characteristics and Drug Resistance of the Prevalent Capsule Types in <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>.	<i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> is a highly antibiotic-resistant pathogen causing nosocomial severe life-threatening infections, especially in critically ill patients. Capsular polysaccharide is a major virulence factor of <i>A. baumannii</i> both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. In this study, 220 isolates were collected in the hospital. The prevalent capsular types of <i>A. baumannii</i> were determined using polymerase chain reaction, and the clinical characteristics of infections were analyzed. The virulence of these strains was determined by serum-killing resistance, biofilm formation, and <i>Galleria mellonella</i> survival assays. Twenty-eight isolates (12.7%) carried KL2, and 22 isolates (10%) carried the types KL10, KL14, KL22, and KL52. Compared with non-KL2 (KL10, KL14, KL22, and KL52) isolates, KL2 isolates had significantly higher resistance to all antimicrobials except tigecycline, cefoperazone-sulbactam, or colistin. Seventy-five percent of KL2 <i>A. baumannii</i> and 72.7% of non-KL2 were highly virulent using a <i>G. mellonella</i> model. Biofilm formation was significantly different between the KL2 and non-KL2 groups. The biofilm production of non-KL2 <i>A. baumannii</i> was significantly stronger than that of KL2 <i>A. baumannii.</i> These findings highlight the role of KL2 as a powerful factor for drug resistance and virulence of <i>A. baumannii.</i>	2023 Apr	Jiao Chen, Guanghui Li, Fen Wan, Peng Liu, Fangling Du, Yanting Shao, Qi Zhang, Zhibin Cheng, Yang Liu	Microb Drug Resist
36551489	Optimization of Pyrazole Compounds as Antibiotic Adjuvants Active against Colistin- and Carbapenem-Resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>.	The diffusion of antibiotic-resistant, Gram-negative, opportunistic pathogens, an increasingly important global public health issue, causes a significant socioeconomic burden. <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> isolates, despite causing a lower number of infections than Enterobacterales, often show multidrug-resistant phenotypes. Carbapenem resistance is also rather common, prompting the WHO to include carbapenem-resistant <i>A. baumannii</i> as a "critical priority" for the discovery and development of new antibacterial agents. In a previous work, we identified several series of compounds showing either direct-acting or synergistic activity against relevant Gram-negative species, including <i>A. baumannii.</i> Among these, two pyrazole compounds, despite being devoid of any direct-acting activity, showed remarkable synergistic activity in the presence of a subinhibitory concentration of colistin on <i>K. pneumoniae</i> and <i>A. baumannii</i> and served as a starting point for the synthesis of new analogues. In this work, a new series of 47 pyrazole compounds was synthesized. Some compounds showed significant direct-acting antibacterial activity on Gram-positive organisms. Furthermore, an evaluation of their activity as potential antibiotic adjuvants allowed for the identification of two highly active compounds on MDR <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>, including colistin-resistant isolates. This work confirms the interest in pyrazole amides as a starting point for the optimization of synergistic antibacterial compounds active on antibiotic-resistant, Gram-negative pathogens.	2022 Dec	Filomena Sannio, Antonella Brizzi, Rosita Del Prete, Marialuce Avigliano, Tiziana Simone, Carlotta Pagli, Teresa Ferraro, Filomena De Luca, Marco Paolino, Federico Corelli, Claudia Mugnaini, Jean-Denis Docquier	Antibiotics (Basel)
35811021	The type VI secretion system in Acinetobacter baumannii clinical isolates and its roles in antimicrobial resistance acquisition.	Acinetobacter baumannii is a successful pathogen that can acquire various antibiotic resistance in a short time. However, little is known about how it can evolve from an antibiotic sensitive to a resistant phenotype. In this study, we investigated the roles of the type VI secretion system (T6SS) in the acquisition of antibiotic resistance of A. baumannii. T6SS gene cluster was found to be present in 51 of 77 A. baumannii clinical isolates, of which, it was found in 62% (8/13) of the multiple drug resistant (MDR) isolates, 90% (36/40) of the extensively drug-resistant (XDR) isolates and 26% (6/23) of the antibiotic sensitive isolates. There is a close relationship between the antimicrobial resistance and the presence of T6SS. Besides, T6SS + isolates showed lower biofilm formation activity and higher survival ability in the presence of normal human serum than T6SS- isolates. A. baumannii A152 with complete T6SS can outcompete E.coli effectively and can acquire the antibiotic resistance plasmids released by E.coli. In contrast, the T6SS core gene mutant A152Δhcp showed significantly decreased ability to acquire antimicrobial resistance plasmids from the prey bacteria. These results suggest that T6SS mediated bacterial competition plays important roles in the antimicrobial resistance of A. baumannii, which points out a new direction for us to study the antimicrobial resistance of A. baumannii.	2022 Aug	Jun-Fang Dong, Cun-Wei Liu, Ping Wang, Lei Li, Qing-Hua Zou	Microb Pathog
35347673	Mimusops elengi Flower-Mediated Green Silver Nanoparticles Control Staphylococcus aureus and Acinetobacter baumannii.	The use of antibiotics against infection-causing bacteria is inactivated, due to the presence of antibiotic-degrading enzymes. These enzymes resist the action of antibiotics and make difficult for the already existing antibiotics to break the drug resistance. Hence, there is a need to formulate alternate therapies against the enzymes providing multidrug resistance to bacteria including Staphylococcus aureus and Acinetobacter baumannii. A silver nanoparticle coated with the natural compounds is a way of finding an alternative to the traditional antibiotics. Objective of the study was to identify and assess Mimusops elengi's floral silver nanoparticles (MENP) for its effective antibacterial activity. The methods involved were in silico analysis involving screening by ADME; drug likeness and docking of ligand to the protein (CrtM and CTX-M-15); in vitro analysis which included silver nanoparticle preparation; characterization by UV-Vis spectrum; SEM, FT-IR, DLS, and antimicrobial assays which include agar well diffusion, minimum inhibitory concentration, minimum bactericidal concentration, and anti-biofilm assays. The compounds present in the flower extract were identified and their usability against the enzymes under study was assured by silico screening. The in vitro analysis furthermore supports through showing potent antibacterial activity of MENP against selected organisms. Hence both in silico and in vitro studies reveal that MENP can be used as an alternative to break multidrug resistance.	2022 Jul	Charlz Nithin J, Ranjani S, Hemalatha S	Appl Biochem Biotechnol
35656953	The susceptibility pattern and distribution of blaOXA-23 genes of clinical isolate Acinetobacter baumannii in a tertiary hospital, Indonesia.	Acinetobacter baumannii, a pathogen of concern in hospitals worldwide, has diverse antimicrobial resistance mechanisms leading to limiting the antibiotic options and carbapenemase enzyme production is one of the common mechanisms in carbapenem resistance. The epidemiology and resistance pattern of clinical isolates are critical in developing a prevention and treatment strategy. The aim of this was to determine the prevalence and resistance pattern of carbapenem non-susceptible strains (CNS) A. baumannii at Arifin Achmad General Hospital, Pekanbaru, Indonesia.	2022 May	Dewi Anggraini, Rahmat Azhari Kemal, Usman Hadi, Kuntaman Kuntaman	J Infect Dev Ctries
36470921	The role of pmrCAB genes in colistin-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii.	The progressively increasing antimicrobial-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii infections have enforced the use of colistin as the last option for therapy, resulting in the colistin resistance evolution. This work aimed to study the pmrCAB expression in A. baumannii isolates as well as the presence of the mcr-1 gene. Colistin MICs of 100 A. baumannii isolates were measured using the broth microdilution assay. In four colistin-susceptible and four colistin-resistant isolates, the relative expression of the pmrA, pmrB, and pmrC genes was determined using reverse transcription PCR, and then selected isolates were sequenced using the Sanger technique. Finally, the mcr-1 gene was detected using conventional PCR. The colistin resistance rate among the studied isolates was 49%. The expression levels of pmrA and pmrB were statistically significantly higher in colistin-resistant isolates than in colistin-susceptible ones, while the pmrC expression had no statistically significant change. There was a weak positive correlation between colistin MICs and the expression levels of each of the pmrA and pmrB genes. By sequencing, two colistin-resistant strains with low pmrCAB expression showed insertion mutations 3277188_3277189T in pmrB and 1185149_1185150T in pmrC. Only one isolate (1%) was positive for the presence of mcr-1. We concluded that pmrCAB increased expression and/or mutations may cause colistin resistance in A. baumannii. However, increased pmrC expression may not necessarily result in colistin resistance. In Egypt, this is the first study to reveal the existence of mcr-1 in A. baumanni. This should attract attention in clinical settings due to the ultimate tendency of spreading colistin resistance.	2022 Dec	Shaimaa Mohamed Seleim, Marwa Salah Mostafa, Nadia Hafez Ouda, Rania Yahia Shash	Sci Rep
36638876	Clonal evolution and antimicrobial resistance of Acinetobacter baumannii isolates from Korean hospitals over the last decade.	The wide-spread of drug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii is a global health problem. This study investigated the clonal distribution and antimicrobial resistance of 167 A. baumannii isolates from two Korean university hospitals from 2009 to 2019 by analyzing the sequence types (STs), antimicrobial resistance, and resistance determinants of carbapenems and aminoglycosides. Twenty STs, including 16 pre-existing STs and four unassigned STs, were identified in A. baumannii isolates using the Oxford multilocus sequence typing scheme. Two STs, ST191 (n = 77) and ST451 (n = 40), were prevalent, and majority (n = 153) of the isolates belonged to clonal complex 208. The ST191 isolates were detected during the study period, whereas ST451 isolates were detected after 2016. One hundred forty-seven (87%) of 167 A. baumannii isolates were non-susceptible to carbapenems. The ST191 and ST451 isolates exhibited higher resistance to antimicrobial agents than that of the sporadic ST isolates. Interestingly, ST451 isolates exhibited lower susceptibility to minocycline and tigecycline than the other ST isolates. All carbapenem-non-susceptible A. baumannii isolates, except four, carried the ISAbaI-bla<sub>OXA-23</sub> structure. armA was detected in all amikacin-non-susceptible isolates (n = 128) except for one isolate. Five aminoglycoside-modifying enzyme (AME) genes were detected, but their carriage varied between STs; ant(3″)-Ia and aac(6')-Ib were more common in ST191 than in ST451, while aph(3')-Ia was more common in ST451 than in ST191. This study demonstrated the clonal evolution related to antimicrobial resistance in A. baumannii.	2023 Mar	So Hyun Jun, Da Eun Lee, Hye Ryeong Hwang, Nayeong Kim, Ki Tae Kwon, Yu Kyung Kim, Je Chul Lee	Infect Genet Evol
35746711	Isolation and Characterization of a Novel <i>Siphoviridae</i> Phage, vB_AbaS_TCUP2199, Infecting Multidrug-Resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>.	Multidrug-resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> (MDRAB) is a pathogen recognized as antimicrobial-resistant bacteria involved in healthcare-associated infections. Resistance to antibiotics has made alternative therapies necessary. Bacteriophage therapy is considered a potential solution to treat MDRAB. In this study, we isolated and characterized the phage vB_AbaS_TCUP2199 (TCUP2199), which can infect MDRAB. Morphological analysis revealed that TCUP2199 belongs to the <i>Siphoviridae</i> family. TCUP2199 has a wide host range, can adsorb rapidly (68.28% in 2 min), and has a burst size of 196 PFU/cell. At least 16 distinct structural proteins were visualized by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. A stability test showed that TCUP2199 was stable at 37 °C and pH 7. Genome analysis of TCUP2199 showed that it consists of a double-stranded DNA genome of 79,572 bp with a G+C content of 40.39%, which contains 98 putative open reading frames, none of which is closely related to the bacteriophage genome sequence that was found in the public database. TCUP2199 shows similarity in genomic organization and putative packaging mechanism with <i>Achromobacter</i> phage JWF and <i>Pseudoalteromonas</i> phage KB12-38 based on protein BLAST and phylogenetic analysis. Because of those unique characteristics, we consider TCUP2199 to be a novel phage that is suitable for inclusion in a phage cocktail to treat <i>A. baumannii</i> infection.	2022 Jun	Meity Mardiana, Soon-Hian Teh, Ling-Chun Lin, Nien-Tsung Lin	Viruses
36719216	Phenotypic and Genomic Characterization of Nine String-Positive Carbapenem-Resistant Acinetobacter baumannii Isolates from Israel.	A positive "string test" indicates the ability of bacterial colonies grown on agar plates to form viscous strings of >5 mm when stretched. This phenotype is strongly associated with hypervirulence in Klebsiella pneumoniae but has never been described in carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB), an emerging human pathogen of high clinical significance. In this work, we screened 1,000 CRAB isolates, among which we identified and characterized 9 string-positive CRAB (stCRAB) isolates. Phenotypic and genotypic analyses revealed that the isolates were not phylogenetically related and possessed different antibiotic resistance and virulence profiles. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) showed the presence of capsule in string-positive isolates. String-positive isolates were more motile but did not form more biofilm than non-string-positive isolates. They were less virulent in a murine thigh fitness model and a Galleria mellonella survival assay. In conclusion, here, we describe string-positive A. baumannii isolates and their phenotypic and molecular characteristics. We found that unlike K. pneumoniae, stCRAB isolates were not associated with increased virulence. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Acinetobacter baumannii has been considered a major health care threat in recent years. Despite many efforts, the pathogenesis and molecular mechanism of A. baumannii virulence remain poorly understood. Moreover, the plasticity of its genome frequently gives rise to new and more virulent isolates. Our current study is of significant importance as it concerns a previously undescribed A. baumannii phenotype. The string-positive phenotype is strongly associated with increased fitness and virulence in other Gram-negative bacteria such as K. pneumoniae. Although no clear correlation with virulence or fitness was found in our 9 stCRAB isolates, this could have been due to the limited statistical power of our research. We suggest that this phenotype should be taken into consideration as due to its genome plasticity, the next change can give rise to string-positive and hypervirulent strains, as is known for K. pneumoniae. Additional future research is needed regarding its possible consequences.	2023 Jan	Nadya Rakovitsky, Mor N Lurie-Weinberger, Amichay Hameir, Liat Wulffhart, Alona Keren Paz, David Schwartz, Yehuda Carmeli	Microbiol Spectr

The development and spread of multidrug-resistant organisms (MDRO) is evolving rapidly worldwide. Although effective antibiotics are still available, some infections are difficult to treat. Among MDROs, S. marcescens and A. baumannii are among the difficult-to-treat pathogens causing for instance sepsis and urinary tract infections (UTI). Isothiocyanates (ITC) are natural plant products. The antimicrobial properties of ITC appear to be more effective in combination with some antibiotics.	2022 Nov	Bidii Stephen Ngalah, Katharina Börner, Moritz Kropidlowsky, Johanna Finkbeiner, Alexander Harter, Klaus Biehler, Uwe Frank	Fitoterapia
36122366	<i>In Vitro</i> Reconstitution of Fimsbactin Biosynthesis from <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>.	Siderophores produced via nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) pathways serve as critical virulence factors for many pathogenic bacteria. Improved knowledge of siderophore biosynthesis guides the development of inhibitors, vaccines, and other therapeutic strategies. Fimsbactin A is a mixed ligand siderophore derived from human pathogenic <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> that contains phenolate-oxazoline, catechol, and hydroxamate metal chelating groups branching from a central l-Ser tetrahedral unit via amide and ester linkages. Fimsbactin A is derived from two molecules of l-Ser, two molecules of 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHB), and one molecule of l-Orn and is a product of the <i>fbs</i> biosynthetic operon. Here, we report the complete <i>in vitro</i> reconstitution of fimsbactin A biosynthesis in a cell-free system using purified enzymes. We demonstrate the conversion of l-Orn to <i>N</i><sub>1</sub>-acetyl-<i>N</i><sub>1</sub>-hydroxy-putrescine (ahPutr) via ordered action of FbsJ (decarboxylase), FbsI (flavin <i>N</i>-monooxygenase), and FbsK (<i>N</i>-acetyltransferase). We achieve conversion of l-Ser, DHB, and l-Orn to fimsbactin A using FbsIJK in combination with the NRPS modules FbsEFGH. We also demonstrate chemoenzymatic conversion of synthetic ahPutr to fimsbactin A using FbsEFGH and establish the substrate selectivity for the NRPS adenylation domains in FbsH (DHB) and FbsF (l-Ser). We assign a role for the type II thioesterase FbsM in producing the shunt metabolite 2-(2,3-dihydroxyphenyl)-4,5-dihydrooxazole-4-carboxylic acid (DHB-oxa) via cleavage of the corresponding thioester intermediate that is tethered to NRPS peptidyl carrier domains during biosynthetic assembly. We propose a mechanism for branching NRPS-derived peptides via amide and ester linkages via the dynamic equilibration of <i>N</i>-DHB-Ser and <i>O</i>-DHB-Ser thioester intermediates via hydrolysis of DHB-oxa thioester intermediates. We also propose a genetic signature for NRPS "branching" in the presence of a terminating C-T-C motif (FbsG).	2022 Oct	Jinping Yang, Timothy A Wencewicz	ACS Chem Biol
36876192	Total Synthesis of a Pentasaccharide <i>O</i>-Glycan from <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>.	<i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> is a Gram-negative bacteria associated with drug resistance and infection in healthcare settings. An understanding of both the biological roles and antigenicity of surface molecules of this organism may provide an important step in the prevention and treatment of infection through vaccination or the development of monoclonal antibodies. With this in mind, we have performed the multistep synthesis of a conjugation-ready pentasaccharide <i>O</i>-glycan from <i>A. baumannii</i> with a longest linear synthetic sequence of 19 steps. This target is particularly relevant due to its role in both fitness and virulence across an apparently broad range of clinically relevant strains. Synthetic challenges include formulating an effective protecting group scheme as well as the installation of a particularly difficult glycosidic linkage between the anomeric position of a 2,3-diacetamido-2,3-dideoxy-D-glucuronic acid and the 4-position of D-galactose.	2022 Dec	Dancan K Njeri, Justin R Ragains	European J Org Chem
36680270	Biological Properties of 12 Newly Isolated <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>-Specific Bacteriophages.	Infections with the opportunistic Gram-negative bacterium <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> pose a serious threat today, which is aggravated by the growing problem of multi-drug resistance among bacteria, caused by the overuse of antibiotics. Treatment of infections caused by antibiotic-resistant <i>A. baumannii</i> strains with the use of phage therapy is not only a promising alternative, but sometimes the only option. Therefore, phages specific for clinical multi-drug resistant <i>A. baumannii</i> were searched for in environmental, municipal, and hospital wastewater samples collected from different locations in Poland. The conducted research allowed us to determine the biological properties and morphology of the tested phages. As a result of our research, 12 phages specific for <i>A. baumannii,</i> 11 of which turned out to be temperate and only one lytic, were isolated. Their lytic spectra ranged from 11 to 75%. The plaques formed by most phages were small and transparent, while one of them formed relatively large plaques with a clearly marked 'halo' effect. Based on Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), most of our phages have been classified as siphoviruses (only one phage was classified as a podovirus). All phages have icosahedral capsid symmetry, and 11 of them have a long tail. Optimal multiplicity of infections (MOIs) and the adsorption rate were also determined. MOI values varied depending on the phage-from 0.001 to 10. Based on similarities to known bacteriophages, our <i>A. baumannii</i>-specific phages have been proposed to belong to the <i>Beijerinckvirinae</i> and <i>Junivirinae</i> subfamilies. This study provides an additional tool in the fight against this important pathogen and may boost the interest in phage therapy as an alternative and supplement to the current antibiotics.	2023 Jan	Natalia Bagińska, Marek Adam Harhala, Martyna Cieślik, Filip Orwat, Beata Weber-Dąbrowska, Krystyna Dąbrowska, Andrzej Górski, Ewa Jończyk-Matysiak	Viruses
36718445	Extensively drug-resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>: role of conjugative plasmids in transferring resistance.	<i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> is one of the most successful pathogens that can cause difficult-to-treat nosocomial infections. Outbreaks and infections caused by multi-drug resistant <i>A. baumannii</i> are prevalent worldwide, with only a few antibiotics are currently available for treatments. Plasmids represent an ideal vehicle for acquiring and transferring resistance genes in <i>A. baumannii</i>. Five extensively drug-resistant <i>A. baumannii</i> clinical isolates from three major Jordanian hospitals were fully sequenced. Whole-Genome Sequences (WGS) were used to study the antimicrobial resistance and virulence genes, sequence types, and phylogenetic relationship of the isolates. Plasmids were characterized <i>In-silico</i>, followed by conjugation, and plasmid curing experiments. Eight plasmids were recovered; resistance plasmids carrying either aminoglycosides or sulfonamide genes were detected. Chromosomal resistance genes included <i>bla<sub>OXA-66</sub>, bla<sub>OXA-91</sub>, and bla<sub>OXA-23,</sub></i> and the detected virulence factors were involved in biofilm formation, adhesion, and many other mechanisms. Conjugation and plasmid curing experiments resulted in the transfer or loss of several resistance phenotypes. Plasmid profiling along with phylogenetic analyses revealed high similarities between two <i>A. baumannii</i> isolates recovered from two different intensive care units (ICU). The high similarities between the isolates of the study, especially the two ICU isolates, suggest that there is a common <i>A. baumannii</i> strain prevailing in different ICU wards in Jordanian hospitals. Three resistance genes were plasmid-borne, and the transfer of the resistance phenotype emphasizes the role and importance of conjugative plasmids in spreading resistance among <i>A. baumannii</i> clinical strains.	2023	Qutaiba Ababneh, Sara Al Sbei, Ziad Jaradat, Sebawe Syaj, Neda'a Aldaken, Hamza Ababneh, Zeina Inaya	PeerJ

Acinetobacter baumannii (A. baumannii) is an opportunistic pathogen and has emerged as one of the most troublesome pathogens. Drug resistance in A. baumannii has been reported on a global scale. Minocycline was found to be active against multi-drug resistant A. baumannii and was approved by the FDA for the infections caused by sensitive strains of A. baumannii. However, the emergence of minocycline resistance and its toxic effects still need to be addressed. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the synergistic effects of metformin combined with minocycline on minocycline-resistant A. baumannii.	2022 Sep	Tingting Guo, Xiaoli Sun, Jie Yang, Liying Yang, Mengying Li, Yuhang Wang, Hongmei Jiao, Guocai Li	BMC Microbiol
35639112	Molecular Epidemiology of Carbapenem-Resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> in the United States, 2013-2017.	Healthcare-associated carbapenem-resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> (CRAB) infections are a serious threat associated with global epidemic clones and a variety of carbapenemase gene classes. In this study, we describe the molecular epidemiology, including whole-genome sequencing analysis and antimicrobial susceptibility profiles of 92 selected, nonredundant CRAB collected through public health efforts in the United States from 2013 to 2017. Among the 92 isolates, the Oxford (OX) multilocus sequence typing scheme identified 30 sequence types (STs); the majority of isolates (<i>n</i> = 59, 64%) represented STs belonging to the international clonal complex 92 (CC92<sub>OX</sub>). Among these, ST208<sub>OX</sub> (<i>n</i> = 21) and ST281<sub>OX</sub> (<i>n</i> = 20) were the most common. All isolates carried an OXA-type carbapenemase gene, comprising 20 alleles. Ninety isolates (98%) encoded an intrinsic OXA-51-like enzyme; 67 (73%) harbored an additional acquired <i>bla</i><sub>OXA</sub> gene, most commonly <i>bla</i><sub>OXA-23</sub> (<i>n</i> = 45; 49%). Compared with isolates harboring only intrinsic oxacillinase genes, acquired <i>bla</i><sub>OXA</sub> gene presence was associated with higher prevalence of resistance and a higher median minimum inhibitory concentration to the carbapenem imipenem (64 μg/mL vs. 8 μg/mL), and antibiotics from other drug classes, including penicillin, aminoglycosides, cephalosporins, and polymyxins. These data illustrate the wide distribution of CC92<sub>OX</sub> and high prevalence of acquired <i>bla</i><sub>OXA</sub> carbapenemase genes among CRAB in the United States.	2022 Jun	Susannah L McKay, Nicholas Vlachos, Jonathan B Daniels, Valerie S Albrecht, Valerie A Stevens, J Kamile Rasheed, J Kristie Johnson, Joseph D Lutgring, Maria Sjölund-Karlsson, Alison Laufer Halpin	Microb Drug Resist
36472426	Detection and Typing of Plasmids in Acinetobacter baumannii Using <i>rep</i> Genes Encoding Replication Initiation Proteins.	Plasmids found in Acinetobacter species contribute to the spread of antibiotic resistance genes. They appear to be largely confined to this genus and cannot be typed with available tools and databases. Here, a method for distinguishing and typing these plasmids was developed using a curated, non-redundant set of 621 complete sequences of plasmids from Acinetobacter baumannii. Plasmids were separated into 3 groups based on the Pfam domains of the encoded replication initiation (Rep) protein and a fourth group that lack an identifiable Rep protein. The <i>rep</i> genes of each Rep-encoding group (<i>n</i> = 13 Rep_1, <i>n</i> = 107 RepPriCT_1, <i>n</i> = 351 Rep_3) were then clustered using a threshold of >95% nucleotide identity to define 80 distinct types. Five Rep_1 subgroups, designated R1_T1 to R1-T5, were identified and a sixth reported recently was added. Each R1 type corresponded to a conserved small plasmid sequence. The RepPriCT_1 plasmids fell into 5 subgroups, designated RP-T1 to RP-T5 and the Rep_3 plasmids comprised 69 distinct types (R3-T1 to R3-T69). Three R1, 2 RP and 32 R3 types are represented by only a single plasmid. Over half of the plasmids belong to the 4 most abundant types: the RP-T1 plasmids (<i>n</i> = 97), which include conjugation genes and are often associated with various acquired antibiotic resistance genes, and R3-T1, R3-T2 and R3-T3 (<i>n</i> = 95, 30 and 45, respectively). To facilitate typing and the identification of plasmids in draft genomes using this framework, we established the Acinetobacter Typing database containing representative nucleotide and protein sequences of the type markers (https://github.com/MehradHamidian/AcinetobacterPlasmidTyping). <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Though they contribute to the dissemination of genes that confer resistance to clinically important carbapenem and aminoglycoside antibiotics used to treat life-threatening Acinetobacter baumannii infections, plasmids found in Acinetobacter species have not been well studied. As these plasmids do not resemble those found in other Gram-negative pathogens, available typing systems are unsuitable. The plasmid typing system developed for A. baumannii plasmids with an identifiable <i>rep</i> gene will facilitate the classification and tracking of sequenced plasmids. It will also enable the detection of plasmid-derived contigs present in draft genomes that are widely ignored currently. Hence, it will assist in the tracking of resistance genes and other genes that affect survival in the environment, as they spread through the population. As identical or similar plasmids have been found in other Acinetobacter species, the typing system will also be broadly applicable in identifying plasmids in other members of the genus.	2023 Feb	Margaret M C Lam, Jonathan Koong, Kathryn E Holt, Ruth M Hall, Mehrad Hamidian	Microbiol Spectr
36106080	Cinnamaldehyde derivatives act as antimicrobial agents against <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> through the inhibition of cell division.	<i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> is a pathogen with high intrinsic antimicrobial resistance while multidrug resistant (MDR) and extensively drug resistant (XDR) strains of this pathogen are emerging. Treatment options for infections by these strains are very limited, hence new therapies are urgently needed. The bacterial cell division protein, FtsZ, is a promising drug target for the development of novel antimicrobial agents. We have previously reported limited activity of cinnamaldehyde analogs against <i>Escherichia coli</i>. In this study, we have determined the antimicrobial activity of six cinnamaldehyde analogs for antimicrobial activity against <i>A. baumannii</i>. Microscopic analysis was performed to determine if the compounds inhibit cell division. The on-target effect of the compounds was assessed by analyzing their effect on polymerization and on the GTPase activity of purified FtsZ from <i>A. baumannii</i>. <i>In silico</i> docking was used to assess the binding of cinnamaldehyde analogs. Finally, <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i> safety assays were performed. All six compounds displayed antibacterial activity against the critical priority pathogen <i>A. baumannii</i>, with 4-bromophenyl-substituted <b>4</b> displaying the most potent antimicrobial activity (MIC 32 μg/mL). Bioactivity was significantly increased in the presence of an efflux pump inhibitor for <i>A. baumannii</i> ATCC 19606 (up to 32-fold) and significantly, for extensively drug resistant UW 5075 (greater than 4-fold), suggesting that efflux contributes to the intrinsic resistance of <i>A. baumannii</i> against these agents. The compounds inhibited cell division in <i>A. baumannii</i> as observed by the elongated phenotype and targeted the FtsZ protein as seen from the inhibition of polymerization and GTPase activity. <i>In silico</i> docking predicted that the compounds bind in the interdomain cleft adjacent to the H7 core helix. Di-chlorinated <b>6</b> was devoid of hemolytic activity and cytotoxicity against mammalian cells <i>in vitro</i>, as well as adverse activity in a <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> nematode model <i>in vivo</i>. Together, these findings present halogenated analogs <b>4</b> and <b>6</b> as promising candidates for further development as antimicrobial agents aimed at combating <i>A. baumannii</i>. This is also the first report of FtsZ-targeting compounds with activity against an XDR <i>A. baumannii</i> strain.	2022	Wern Chern Chai, Jonathan J Whittall, Steven W Polyak, Klyie Foo, Xin Li, Cameron J Dutschke, Abiodun D Ogunniyi, Shutao Ma, Matthew J Sykes, Susan J Semple, Henrietta Venter	Front Microbiol

36614160	Application of Antimicrobial Photodynamic Therapy for Inactivation of <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> Biofilms.	<i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> is a dangerous hospital pathogen primarily due to its ability to form biofilms on different abiotic and biotic surfaces. The present study investigated the effect of riboflavin- and chlorophyllin-based antimicrobial photodynamic therapy, performed with near-ultraviolet or blue light on the viability of bacterial cells in biofilms and their structural stability, also determining the extent of photoinduced generation of intracellular reactive oxygen species as well as the ability of <i>A. baumannii</i> to form biofilms after the treatment. The efficacy of antimicrobial photodynamic therapy was compared with that of light alone and the role of the photosensitizer type on the photosensitization mechanism was demonstrated. We found that the antibacterial effect of riboflavin-based antimicrobial photodynamic therapy depends on the ability of photoactivated riboflavin to generate intracellular reactive oxygen species but does not depend on the concentration of riboflavin and pre-incubation time before irradiation. Moreover, our results suggest a clear interconnection between the inactivation efficiency of chlorophyllin-based antimicrobial photodynamic therapy and the sensitivity of <i>A. baumannii</i> biofilms to used light. In summary, all the analyzed results suggest that riboflavin-based antimicrobial photodynamic therapy and chlorophyllin-based antimicrobial photodynamic therapy have the potential to be applied as an antibacterial treatment against <i>A. baumannii</i> biofilms or as a preventive measure against biofilm formation.	2022 Dec	Irina Buchovec, Enrika Vyčaitė, Kazimieras Badokas, Edita Sužiedelienė, Saulius Bagdonas	Int J Mol Sci
36106853	An Unprecedented Tolerance to Deletion of the Periplasmic Chaperones SurA, Skp, and DegP in the Nosocomial Pathogen Acinetobacter baumannii.	The outer membrane (OM) of Gram-negative bacteria efficiently protects from harmful environmental stresses such as antibiotics, disinfectants, or dryness. The main constituents of the OM are integral OM β-barrel proteins (OMPs). In Gram-negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli, Yersinia enterocolitica, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the insertion of OMPs depends on a sophisticated biogenesis pathway. This comprises the SecYEG translocon, which enables inner membrane (IM) passage; the chaperones SurA, Skp, and DegP, which facilitate the passage of β-barrel OMPs through the periplasm; and the β-barrel assembly machinery (BAM), which facilitates insertion into the OM. In E. coli, Y. enterocolitica, and P. aeruginosa, the deletion of SurA is particularly detrimental and leads to a loss of OM integrity, sensitization to antibiotic treatment, and reduced virulence. In search of targets that could be exploited to develop compounds that interfere with OM integrity in Acinetobacter baumannii, we employed the multidrug-resistant strain AB5075 to generate single gene knockout strains lacking individual periplasmic chaperones. In contrast to E. coli, Y. enterocolitica, and P. aeruginosa, AB5075 tolerates the lack of SurA, Skp, or DegP with only weak mutant phenotypes. While the double knockout strains Δ<i>surA</i>Δ<i>skp</i> and Δ<i>surA</i>Δ<i>degP</i> are conditionally lethal in E. coli, all double deletions were well tolerated by AB5075. Strikingly, even a triple-knockout strain of AB5075, lacking <i>surA</i>, <i>skp</i>, and <i>degP</i>, was viable. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Acinetobacter baumannii is a major threat to human health due to its ability to persist in the hospital environment, resistance to antibiotic treatment, and ability to deploy multiple and redundant virulence factors. In a rising number of cases, infections with multidrug-resistant A. baumannii end up fatally, because all antibiotic treatment options fail. Thus, novel targets have to be identified and alternative therapeutics have to be developed. The knockout of periplasmic chaperones has previously proven to significantly reduce virulence and even break antibiotic resistance in other Gram-negative pathogens. Our study in A. baumannii demonstrates how variable the importance of the periplasmic chaperones SurA, Skp, and DegP can be and suggests the existence of mechanisms allowing A. baumannii to cope with the lack of the three periplasmic chaperones.	2022 Oct	Karolin Birkle, Fabian Renschler, Angel Angelov, Gottfried Wilharm, Mirita Franz-Wachtel, Boris Maček, Erwin Bohn, Elena Weber, Jennifer Müller, Lea Friedrich, Monika Schütz	J Bacteriol
36179976	Bovine skin fibroblasts mediated immune responses to defend against bovine Acinetobacter baumannii infection.	Acinetobacter baumannii (A. baumannii) is an opportunistic pathogen which can cause pneumonia, sepsis and infections of skin and soft tissue. The host mostly relies on innate immune responses to defend against the infection of A. baumannii. Currently, it has been confirmed that fibroblasts involved in innate immune responses. Therefore, to explore how bovine skin fibroblasts mediated immune responses to defend against A. baumannii infection, we analyzed the differential transcripts data of bovine skin fibroblasts infected with bovine A. baumannii by RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq). We found that there were 3014 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) at 14h with bovine A. baumannii infection, including 1940 up-regulated genes and 1074 down-regulated genes. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment showed that ubiquitin protein ligase binding, IL-6 receptor complex, ERK1 and ERK2 cascade terms were mainly enriched. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment showed that innate immune pathways were significantly enriched, such as TNF, IL-17, NLR, MAPK, NF-κB, endocytosis, apoptosis and HIF-1 signaling pathways. Furthermore, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) revealed that GO terms such as chemokine receptor binding and Th17 cell differentiation and KEGG pathways such as TLR and cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction pathways were up-regulated. In addition, CASP3 and JUN were the core functional genes of apoptosis, while IL-6, ERBB2, EGFR, CHUK and MAPK8 were the core functional genes of immunity by Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) analysis. Our study provided an in-depth understanding of the molecular mechanisms of fibroblasts against A. baumannii infection. It also lays the foundation for the development of new therapeutic targets for the diseases caused by A. baumannii infection and formulates effective therapeutic strategies for the prevention and control of the diseases caused by A. baumannii.	2022 Dec	Simeng Hou, Haotian Wu, Si Chen, Xubo Li, Zhenxing Zhang, Yiwen Cheng, Yuanyuan Chen, Meirong He, Qi An, Churiga Man, Li Du, Qiaoling Chen, Fengyang Wang	Microb Pathog
35947200	Characterization of Sequence Types and Mechanisms of Resistance to Tigecycline Among Acinetobacter baumannii Isolated from Children.	The present study aimed to investigate the mechanisms of resistance to tigecycline and to determine sequence types of Acinetobacter baumannii isolates recovered from children, using the Multilocus Sequence Typing (MLST). A total of 74 A. baumannii isolates were recovered from patients at one of the children's hospital in Tehran, Iran. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing of the isolates was performed for different classes of antibiotics and minimum inhibitory concentrations of colistin and tigecycline were determined using broth microdilution method and E-test strips, respectively. The presence of ISAba1, AbaR, tet(39), and tetX and the expressions of adeB, adeG, and adeJ efflux pump genes were measured using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and quantitative real-time PCR (RT-PCR), respectively. The diversity of mutations across the regulatory genes of RND efflux pumps (adeRS, adeL, and adeN) and trm gene were determined using their PCR amplification and DNA sequencing in tigecycline-resistant isolates. In addition, STs of tigecycline-resistant isolates were determined using MLST method. Three A. baumannii isolates were resistant to tigecycline. Several amino acid substitutions were identified in AdeRS, AdeN, and Trm but no alteration was found in AdeL. Nevertheless, adeB, adeG, and adeJ overexpression were observed in 1, 2, and 1 isolates, respectively. The tigecycline-resistant isolates belonged to ST1720 and ST2285. This is the first study reporting on ST2285 in A. baumannii populations. Among 74 isolates, two tigecycline susceptible isolates carried tet(39) gene but no tetX gene was detected. We concluded that mutations in regulatory genes of RND efflux pumps and the trm gene may play some important role in A. baumannii resistance to tigecycline.	2022 Aug	Zohreh Ghalavand, Gita Eslami, Ali Hashemi, Mehrzad Sadredinamin, Neda Yousefi, Razieh Dehbanipour	Curr Microbiol
37151210	Outer Membrane Vesicle-Coated Nanoparticle Vaccine Protects Against <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> Pneumonia and Sepsis.	The highly multidrug-resistant (MDR) Gram-negative bacterial pathogen <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> is a top global health priority where an effective vaccine could protect susceptible populations and limit resistance acquisition. Outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) shed from Gram-negative bacteria are enriched with virulence factors and membrane lipids but heterogeneous in size and cargo. We report a vaccine platform combining precise and replicable nanoparticle technology with immunogenic <i>A. baumannii</i> OMVs (Ab-OMVs). Gold nanoparticle cores coated with Ab-OMVs (Ab-NPs) induced robust IgG titers in rabbits that enhanced human neutrophil opsonophagocytic killing and passively protected against lethal <i>A. baumannii</i> sepsis in mice. Active Ab-NP immunization in mice protected against sepsis and pneumonia, accompanied by B cell recruitment to draining lymph nodes, activation of dendritic cell markers, improved splenic neutrophil responses, and mitigation of proinflammatory cytokine storm. Nanoparticles are an efficient and efficacious platform for OMV vaccine delivery against <i>A. baumannii</i> and perhaps other high-priority MDR pathogens.	2023 Feb	Elisabet Bjanes, Jiarong Zhou, Tariq Qayum, Nishta Krishnan, Raymond H Zurich, Nitasha D Menon, Alexandria Hoffman, Ronnie H Fang, Liangfang Zhang, Victor Nizet	Adv Nanobiomed Res
36605106	Intensification in Genetic Information and Acquisition of Resistant Genes in Genome of <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>: A Pan-Genomic Analysis.	<i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> (<i>A. baumannii</i>) attributes 26% of the mortality rate in hospitalized patients, and the percentage can rise to 46 in patients admitted to ICU as it is a major cause of ventilator-associated pneumonia. It has been nominated as the critical priority organism by WHO for which new therapeutic drugs are urgently required. To understand the genomic identification of different strains, antimicrobial resistance patterns, and epidemiological typing of organisms, whole-genome sequencing (WGS) analysis provides insight to explore new epitopes to develop new drugs against the organism. Therefore, the study is aimed at investigating the whole genome sequence of <i>A. baumannii</i> strains to report the new intensifications in its genomic profile. The genome sequences were retrieved from the NCBI database system. Pan-genome BPGA (Bacterial Pan-genome Analysis Tool) was used to analyze the core, pan, and species-specific genome analysis. The pan and core genome curves were extrapolated using the empirical power law equation <i>f</i>(<i>x</i>) = <i>a</i>.<i>xb</i> and the exponential equation <i>f</i>1(<i>x</i>) = <i>c</i>.<i>e</i> (<i>d</i>.<i>x</i>). To identify the resistant genes with resistant mutations against antibiotics, ResFinder and Galaxy Community hub bioinformatics tools were used. According to pan-genome analysis, there were 2227 core genes present in each species of the <i>A. baumannii</i> genome. Furthermore, the number of accessory genes ranged from 1182 to 1460, and the unique genes in the genome were 931. There were 325 exclusively absent genes in the genome of <i>Acinetobacter baumannii.</i> The pan-genome analysis showed that there is a 5-fold increase in the genome of <i>A. baumannii</i> in 5 years, and the genome is still open. There is the addition of multiple unique genes; among them, genes participating in the function of information and processing are increased.	2022	Akhtar Ali, Ambrina Khatoon, Talat Mirza, Farah Ahmad	Biomed Res Int
36619166	The <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> model can explain the role of small non-coding RNAs as potential mediators of host-pathogen interactions.	Bacterial small RNAs (sRNAs) research has accelerated over the past decade, boosted by advances in RNA-seq technologies and methodologies for capturing both protein-RNA and RNA-RNA interactions. The emerging picture is that these regulatory sRNAs play important roles in controlling complex physiological processes and are required to survive the antimicrobial challenge. In recent years, the RNA content of OMVs/EVs has also gained increasing attention, particularly in the context of infection. Secreted RNAs from several bacterial pathogens have been characterized but the exact mechanisms promoting pathogenicity remain elusive. In this review, we briefly discuss how secreted sRNAs interact with targets in infected cells, thus representing a novel perspective of host cell manipulation during bacterial infection. During the last decade, <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> became clinically relevant emerging pathogens responsible for nosocomial and community-acquired infections. Therefore, we also summarize recent findings of regulation by sRNAs in <i>A. baumannii</i> and discuss how this emerging bacterium utilizes many of these sRNAs to adapt to its niche and become successful human pathogen.	2022	Meysam Sarshar, Daniela Scribano, Anna Teresa Palamara, Cecilia Ambrosi, Andrea Masotti	Front Mol Biosci
36581226	Antibacterial activity of silver nanoparticles functionalized with amikacin applied against multidrug-resistant acinetobacter baumannii.	Multidrug-resistant bacteria are one of the world's biggest health problems; therefore, improving the spectrum of action of antibiotics could be necessary to reverse this situation. Amikacin and silver salts have well-known antimicrobial properties. However, both drugs lost their effectiveness against some bacteria, such as Acinetobacter baumannii. This work aims to develop a nanodrug from silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) functionalized with Amikacin against multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii.	2022 Dec	Larissa de O Camargo, Inglid Fontoura, Thaís S Veriato, Leandro Raniero, Maiara L Castilho	Am J Infect Control
36710969	Role of peptidoglycan recycling enzymes AmpD and AnmK in <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> virulence features.	<i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> is an important causative agent of hospital acquired infections. In addition to acquired resistance to many currently-available antibiotics, it is intrinsically resistant to fosfomycin. It has previously been shown that AmpD and AnmK contribute to intrinsic fosfomycin resistance in <i>A. baumannii</i> due to their involvement in the peptidoglycan recycling pathway. However, the role that these two enzymes play in the fitness and virulence of <i>A. baumannii</i> has not been studied. The aim of this study was to characterize several virulence-related phenotypic traits in <i>A. baumannii</i> mutants lacking AmpD and AnmK. Specifically, cell morphology, peptidoglycan thickness, membrane permeability, growth under iron-limiting conditions, fitness, resistance to disinfectants and antimicrobial agents, twitching motility and biofilm formation of the mutant strains <i>A. baumannii</i> ATCC 17978 Δ<i>ampD</i>::Kan and Δ<i>anmK</i>::Kan were compared to the wild type strain. Our results demonstrate that bacterial growth and fitness of both mutants were compromised, especially in the Δ<i>ampD</i>::Kan mutant. In addition, biofilm formation was decreased by up to 69%, whereas twitching movement was reduced by about 80% in both mutants. These results demonstrate that, in addition to increased susceptibility to fosfomycin, alteration of the peptidoglycan recycling pathway affects multiple aspects related to virulence. Inhibition of these enzymes could be explored as a strategy to develop novel treatments for <i>A. baumannii</i> in the future. Furthermore, this study establishes a link between intrinsic fosfomycin resistance mechanisms and bacterial fitness and virulence traits.	2022	Ana Tajuelo, María C Terrón, Mireia López-Siles, Michael J McConnell	Front Cell Infect Microbiol

37110301	Phenotypic and Molecular Characteristics of Carbapenem-Resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> Isolates from Bulgarian Intensive Care Unit Patients.	Carbapenem-resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> (CRAB) is designated as an urgent public health threat, both due to its remarkable multidrug resistance and propensity for clonal spread. This study aimed to explore the phenotypic and molecular characteristics of antimicrobial resistance in CRAB isolates (<i>n</i> = 73) from intensive care unit (ICU) patients in two university hospitals in Bulgaria (2018-2019). The methodology included antimicrobial susceptibility testing, PCR, whole-genome sequencing (WGS), and phylogenomic analysis. The resistance rates were as follows: imipenem, 100%; meropenem, 100%; amikacin, 98.6%; gentamicin, 89%; tobramycin, 86.3%; levofloxacin, 100%; trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, 75.3%; tigecycline, 86.3%; colistin, 0%; and ampicillin-sulbactam, 13.7%. All isolates harbored <i>bla</i><sub>OXA-51-like</sub> genes. The frequencies of distribution of other antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) were: <i>bla</i><sub>OXA-23-like</sub>, 98.6%; <i>bla</i><sub>OXA-24/40-like</sub>, 2.7%; <i>armA</i>, 86.3%; and <i>sul1</i>, 75.3%. The WGS of selected extensively drug-resistant <i>A. baumannii</i> (XDR-AB) isolates (<i>n</i> = 3) revealed the presence of OXA-23 and OXA-66 carbapenem-hydrolyzing class D β-lactamases in all isolates, and OXA-72 carbapenemase in one of them. Various insertion sequencies, such as IS<i>Aba24</i>, IS<i>Aba31</i>, IS<i>Aba125</i>, IS<i>Vsa3</i>, IS<i>17</i>, and IS<i>6100</i>, were also detected, providing increased ability for horizontal transfer of ARGs. The isolates belonged to the widespread high-risk sequence types ST2 (<i>n</i> = 2) and ST636 (<i>n</i> = 1) (Pasteur scheme). Our results show the presence of XDR-AB isolates, carrying a variety of ARGs, in Bulgarian ICU settings, which highlights the crucial need for nationwide surveillance, especially in the conditions of extensive antibiotic usage during COVID-19.	2023 Mar	Tanya V Strateva, Ivo Sirakov, Temenuga J Stoeva, Alexander Stratev, Slavil Peykov	Microorganisms
35982877	A Microbiological Study of <i>Acinetobacter calcoaceticus baumannii</i> with Special Reference to Multidrug Resistance.	<b>Introduction</b>  The outbreak of <i>Acinetobacter calcoaceticus baumannii</i> ( <i>ACB</i> ) is mainly reported to be a notorious pathogens at health-care settings. It is the major problem on the health-care system with high morbidity and mortality rates because of the broad range of antibiotic resistance and lack of understanding the mechanism of developing new antibiotic resistance rapidly. It emphasizes the importance of local surveillance in describing or understanding and predicting microbial resistance patterns so that there will be limited use of antibiotics by developing strategies to control the extensive use of antimicrobial chemotherapy in clinical environment, which is still considered as one of the factors in the emergence of multidrug resistance microorganisms. <b>Objectives</b>  The study aims to detect the occurrence rate of <i>ACB</i> infections from various clinical samples, identify the resistance levels to different groups of antimicrobial agents, and the occurrence rate of multidrug resistant (MDR) <i>ACB</i> clinical isolates from a tertiary hospital in Durgapur, West Bengal, India. <b>Material and Methods</b>  The study was performed in the Department of Microbiology of the IQ City Medical College and Hospital, Durgapur, West Bengal, India, for the 24 months duration, that is, from January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2019. Altogether 15,800 clinical samples consisting of endotracheal tube aspirates, sputum, pus, blood, catheter tips, urine, tissue, and other body fluids were studied. <i>ACB</i> from clinical samples were identified by its characteristic colonies (nonlactose fermenting, glistening, small mucoid colonies), Gram-staining pattern (Gram-negative coccobacillus), and standard biochemical reactions. It was further confirmed in the Department of Microbiology of the Healthworld Hospital, Durgapur, West Bengal, India, by Vitek2 compact system (bioMerieux, Inc., Durham, North Carolina, United States). Antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed using automated broth microdilutions by Vitek2 compact system (bioMerieux, Inc.) and Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion test on Mueller-Hinton Agar (HiMedia). <b>Results</b>  Nonrepetitive 289 <i>ACB</i> were isolated from various clinical samples. A total of 277 (96%) isolates of <i>ACB</i> were MDR strains. <b>Conclusion</b>   <i>ACB</i> was mostly isolated from the intensive care unit department and was found to be the most MDR type in the tertiary care hospital by this study.	2022 Jun	Langamba Angom Longjam, Dechen Chomu Tsering, Dipmala Das	J Lab Physicians
36079137	The Burden of Carbapenem-Resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> in ICU COVID-19 Patients: A Regional Experience.	Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the impact of superinfections in intensive care units (ICUs) has progressively increased, especially carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CR-Ab). This observational, multicenter, retrospective study was designed to investigate the characteristics of COVID-19 ICU patients developing CR-Ab colonization/infection during an ICU stay and evaluate mortality risk factors in a regional ICU network. A total of 913 COVID-19 patients were admitted to the participating ICUs; 19% became positive for CR-Ab, either colonization or infection (n = 176). The ICU mortality rate in CR-Ab patients was 64.7%. On average, patients developed colonization or infection within 10 ± 8.4 days from ICU admission. Scores of SAPS II and SOFA were significantly higher in the deceased patients (43.8 ± 13.5, p = 0.006 and 9.5 ± 3.6, p < 0.001, respectively). The mortality rate was significantly higher in patients with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (12; 7%, p = 0.03), septic shock (61; 35%, p < 0.001), and in elders (66 ± 10, p < 0.001). Among the 176 patients, 129 (73%) had invasive infection with CR-Ab: 105 (60.7%) Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP), and 46 (26.6%) Bloodstream Infections (BSIs). In 22 cases (6.5%), VAP was associated with concomitant BSI. Colonization was reported in 165 patients (93.7%). Mortality was significantly higher in patients with VAP (p = 0.009). Colonized patients who did not develop invasive infections had a higher survival rate (p < 0.001). Being colonized by CR-Ab was associated with a higher risk of developing invasive infections (p < 0.001). In a multivariate analysis, risk factors significantly associated with mortality were age (OR = 1.070; 95% CI (1.028−1.115) p = 0.001) and CR-Ab colonization (OR = 5.463 IC95% 1.572−18.988, p = 0.008). Constant infection-control measures are necessary to stop the spread of A. baumannii in the hospital environment, especially at this time of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, with active surveillance cultures and the efficient performance of a multidisciplinary team.	2022 Sep	Giorgia Montrucchio, Silvia Corcione, Tommaso Lupia, Nour Shbaklo, Carlo Olivieri, Miriam Poggioli, Aline Pagni, Davide Colombo, Agostino Roasio, Stefano Bosso, Fabrizio Racca, Valeria Bonato, Francesco Della Corte, Stefania Guido, Andrea Della Selva, Enrico Ravera, Nicoletta Barzaghi, Martina Cerrano, Pietro Caironi, Giacomo Berta, Cecilia Casalini, Bruno Scapino, Michele Grio, Massimiliano Parlanti Garbero, Gabriella Buono, Federico Finessi, Simona Erbetta, Paola Federica Sciacca, Gilberto Fiore, Alessandro Cerutti, Sergio Livigni, Daniela Silengo, Fulvio Agostini, Maurizio Berardino, Mauro Navarra, Silvia Vendramin, Enzo Castenetto, Marco Maria Liccardi, Emilpaolo Manno, Luca Brazzi, Francesco Giuseppe De Rosa	J Clin Med

36108779	Bio-physical mechanisms of dehydrating membranes of Acinetobacter baumannii linked to drought-resistance.	Acinetobacter baumanni, is an opportunistic nosocomial multi-drug resistant bacterium, which represents a threat for human health. This pathogen is able to persist in intensive care units thanks to its extraordinary resistance towards dehydration, whose mechanisms are unknown and enable it to easily spread through surfaces, contaminating also medical devices. In this article we reveal, with a multimodal approach, based on μ-R Spectroscopy, Gas Chromatography coupled to Mass Spectroscopy, Atomic Force Microscopy and Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching, the bio-physical mechanisms that the membrane of two A. baumannii strains undergoes during dehydration. Showing a substantial decoupling of the phase transition from liquid crystalline to gel phase from evidence of cell lysis. Such decoupling may be the core of the resistance of A. baumannii against dehydration and highlights the different ability to resist to drought between strains.	2022 Dec	Elisa Fardelli, Massimiliano Lucidi, Michael Di Gioacchino, Shadi Bashiri, Luca Persichetti, Giulia Capecchi, Tecla Gasperi, Armida Sodo, Paolo Visca, Giovanni Capellini	Biochim Biophys Acta Biomembr

35748948	PhageScore-based analysis of Acinetobacter baumannii infecting phages antibiotic interaction in liquid medium.	The growing interest in bacteriophages and antibiotics' combined use poses new challenges regarding this phenomenon's accurate description. This study aimed to apply the PhageScore methodology to assess the phage-antibiotic combination activity in liquid bacterial culture. For this purpose, previously described Acinetobacter infecting phages vB_AbaP_AGC01, Aba-1, and Aba-4 and antibiotics (gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, meropenem, norfloxacin, and fosfomycin) were used to obtain a lysis curve of bacteriophages under antibiotic pressure. The experimental data were analyzed using the Fractional Inhibitory Concentration Index (FICI) and PhageScore methodology. The results obtained by this method clearly show differences between phage lytic activity after antibiotic addition. Thus, we present the potential use of the PhageScore method as a tool for characterizing the phage antibiotic synergy in liquid culture. Further, the optimization of the PhageScore for this purpose can help compare antibiotics and their outcome on bacteriophage lytic activity.	2022 Jun	Bartłomiej Grygorcewicz, Marta Roszak, Rafał Rakoczy, Adrian Augustyniak, Maciej Konopacki, Joanna Jabłońska, Natalia Serwin, Elżbieta Cecerska-Heryć, Marian Kordas, Katarzyna Galant, Barbara Dołęgowska	Arch Microbiol
36289956	Evaluating the Efficacy of Eravacycline and Omadacycline against Extensively Drug-Resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> Patient Isolates.	For decades, the spread of multidrug-resistant (MDR) <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> has been rampant in critically ill, hospitalized patients. Traditional antibiotic therapies against this pathogen have been failing, leading to rising concerns over management options for patients. Two new antibiotics, eravacycline and omadacycline, were introduced to the market and have shown promising results in the treatment of Gram-negative infections. Since these drugs are newly available, there is limited in vitro data about their effectiveness against MDR <i>A. baumannii</i> or even susceptible strains. Here, we examined the effectiveness of 22 standard-of-care antibiotics, eravacycline, and omadacycline against susceptible and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) <i>A. baumannii</i> patient isolates from Cooper University Hospital. Furthermore, we examined selected combinations of eravacycline or omadacycline with other antibiotics against an XDR strain. We demonstrated that this collection of strains is largely resistant to monotherapies of carbapenems, fluoroquinolones, folate pathway antagonists, cephalosporins, and most tetracyclines. While clinical breakpoint data are not available for eravacycline or omadacycline, based on minimum inhibitory concentrations, eravacycline was highly effective against these strains. The aminoglycoside amikacin alone and in combination with eravacycline or omadacycline yielded the most promising results. Our comprehensive characterization offers direction in the treatment of this deadly infection in hospitalized patients.	2022 Sep	Manas S Deolankar, Rachel A Carr, Rebecca Fliorent, Sean Roh, Henry Fraimow, Valerie J Carabetta	Antibiotics (Basel)
36985130	Genomic Diversity, Antimicrobial Susceptibility, and Biofilm Formation of Clinical <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> Isolates from Horses.	<i>Acinetobacter (A.) baumannii</i> is an opportunistic pathogen that causes severe infections in humans and animals, including horses. The occurrence of dominant international clones (ICs), frequent multidrug resistance, and the capability to form biofilms are considered major factors in the successful spread of <i>A. baumannii</i> in human and veterinary clinical environments. Since little is known about <i>A. baumannii</i> isolates from horses, we studied 78 equine <i>A. baumannii</i> isolates obtained from clinical samples between 2008 and 2020 for their antimicrobial resistance (AMR), clonal distribution, biofilm-associated genes (BAGs), and biofilm-forming capability. Based on whole-genome sequence analyses, ICs, multilocus (ML) and core-genome ML sequence types (STs), and AMR genes were determined. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by microbroth dilution. A crystal violet assay was used for biofilm quantification. Almost 37.2% of the isolates were assigned to IC1 (10.3%), IC2 (20.5%), and IC3 (6.4%). Overall, the isolates revealed high genomic diversity. We identified 51 different STs, including 22 novel STs (ST1723-ST1744), and 34 variants of the intrinsic oxacillinase (OXA), including 8 novel variants (OXA-970 to OXA-977). All isolates were resistant to ampicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, cephalexin, cefpodoxime, and nitrofurantoin. IC1-IC3 isolates were also resistant to gentamicin, enrofloxacin, marbofloxacin, tetracycline, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. All isolates were susceptible to imipenem. Thirty-one multidrug-resistant (MDR) isolates mainly accumulated in the IC1-IC3 groups. In general, these isolates showed less biofilm formation (IC1 = 25.0%, IC2 = 18.4%, IC3 = 15.0%) than the group of non-IC1-IC3 isolates (58.4%). Isolates belonging to the same ICs/STs revealed identical BAG patterns. BAG <i>blp1</i> was absent in all isolates, whereas <i>bfmR</i> and <i>pgaA</i> were present in all isolates. At the level of the IC groups, the AMR status was negatively correlated with the isolates' ability to form a biofilm. A considerable portion of equine <i>A. baumannii</i> isolates revealed ICs/STs that are globally present in humans. Both an MDR phenotype and the capability to form biofilms might lead to therapeutic failures in equine medicine, particularly due to the limited availability of licensed drugs.	2023 Feb	Johanna Rühl-Teichner, Lisa Jacobmeyer, Ursula Leidner, Torsten Semmler, Christa Ewers	Microorganisms
37018035	Molecular characterization and comparative genomic analysis of <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> isolated from the community and the hospital: an epidemiological study in Segamat, Malaysia.	<i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> is a common cause of multidrug-resistant (MDR) nosocomial infections around the world. However, little is known about the persistence and dynamics of <i>A. baumannii</i> in a healthy community. This study investigated the role of the community as a prospective reservoir for <i>A. baumannii</i> and explored possible links between hospital and community isolates. A total of 12 independent <i>A. baumannii</i> strains were isolated from human faecal samples from the community in Segamat, Malaysia, in 2018 and 2019. Another 15 were obtained in 2020 from patients at the co-located tertiary public hospital. The antimicrobial resistance profile and biofilm formation ability were analysed, and the relatedness of community and hospital isolates was determined using whole-genome sequencing (WGS). Antibiotic profile analysis revealed that 12 out of 15 hospital isolates were MDR, but none of the community isolates were MDR. However, phylogenetic analysis based on single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and a pangenome analysis of core genes showed clustering between four community and two hospital strains. Such clustering of strains from two different settings based on their genomes suggests that these strains could persist in both. WGS revealed 41 potential resistance genes on average in the hospital strains, but fewer (<i>n</i>=32) were detected in the community strains. In contrast, 68 virulence genes were commonly seen in strains from both sources. This study highlights the possible transmission threat to public health posed by virulent <i>A. baumannii</i> present in the gut of asymptomatic individuals in the community.	2023 Apr	Nazmul Hasan Muzahid, Md Hamed Hussain, Marie Andrea Laetitia Huët, Jacky Dwiyanto, Tin Tin Su, Daniel Reidpath, Faizah Mustapha, Qasim Ayub, Hock Siew Tan, Sadequr Rahman	Microb Genom
36671295	In Vitro Synergistic Activity of Antimicrobial Combinations against Carbapenem- and Colistin-Resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> and <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i>.	Polymyxins are commonly used as the last resort for the treatment of MDR <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> and <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i> nosocomial infections; however, apart from the already known toxicity issues, resistance to these agents is emerging. In the present study, we assessed the in vitro synergistic activity of antimicrobial combinations against carbapenem-resistant and colistin-resistant <i>A. baumannii</i> and <i>K. pneumoniae</i> in an effort to provide more options for their treatment. Two hundred <i>A. baumannii</i> and one hundred and six <i>K. pneumoniae</i> single clinical isolates with resistance to carbapenems and colistin, recovered between 1 January 2021 and 31 July 2022,were included. <i>A. baumannii</i> were tested by the MIC test strip fixed-ratio method for combinations of colistin with either meropenem or rifampicin or daptomycin. <i>K. pneumoniae</i> were tested for the combinations of colistin with meropenem and ceftazidime/avibactam with aztreonam. Synergy was observed at: 98.99% for colistin and meropenem against <i>A. baumannii</i>; 91.52% for colistin and rifampicin; and 100% for colistin and daptomycin. Synergy was also observed at: 73.56% for colistin and meropenem against <i>K. pneumoniae</i> and; and 93% for ceftazidime/avibactam with aztreonam. The tested antimicrobial combinations presented high synergy rates, rendering them valuable options against <i>A. baumannii</i> and <i>K. pneumoniae</i> infections.	2023 Jan	Paraskevi Mantzana, Efthymia Protonotariou, Angeliki Kassomenaki, Georgios Meletis, Areti Tychala, Eirini Keskilidou, Maria Arhonti, Charikleia Katsanou, Aikaterini Daviti, Olga Vasilaki, Georgia Kagkalou, Lemonia Skoura	Antibiotics (Basel)
35625321	The Specific Capsule Depolymerase of Phage PMK34 Sensitizes <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> to Serum Killing.	The rising antimicrobial resistance is particularly alarming for <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>, calling for the discovery and evaluation of alternatives to treat <i>A. baumannii</i> infections. Some bacteriophages produce a structural protein that depolymerizes capsular exopolysaccharide. Such purified depolymerases are considered as novel antivirulence compounds. We identified and characterized a depolymerase (DpoMK34) from Acinetobacter phage vB_AbaP_PMK34 active against the clinical isolate <i>A. baumannii</i> MK34. In silico analysis reveals a modular protein displaying a conserved N-terminal domain for anchoring to the phage tail, and variable central and C-terminal domains for enzymatic activity and specificity. AlphaFold-Multimer predicts a trimeric protein adopting an elongated structure due to a long α-helix, an enzymatic β-helix domain and a hypervariable 4 amino acid hotspot in the most ultimate loop of the C-terminal domain. In contrast to the tail fiber of phage T3, this hypervariable hotspot appears unrelated with the primary receptor. The functional characterization of DpoMK34 revealed a mesophilic enzyme active up to 50 °C across a wide pH range (4 to 11) and specific for the capsule of <i>A. baumannii</i> MK34. Enzymatic degradation of the <i>A. baumannii</i> MK34 capsule causes a significant drop in phage adsorption from 95% to 9% after 5 min. Although lacking intrinsic antibacterial activity, DpoMK34 renders <i>A. baumannii</i> MK34 fully susceptible to serum killing in a serum concentration dependent manner. Unlike phage PMK34, DpoMK34 does not easily select for resistant mutants either against PMK34 or itself. In sum, DpoMK34 is a potential antivirulence compound that can be included in a depolymerase cocktail to control difficult to treat <i>A. baumannii</i> infections.	2022 May	Karim Abdelkader, Diana Gutiérrez, Agnieszka Latka, Dimitri Boeckaerts, Zuzanna Drulis-Kawa, Bjorn Criel, Hans Gerstmans, Amal Safaan, Ahmed S Khairalla, Yasser Gaber, Tarek Dishisha, Yves Briers	Antibiotics (Basel)
36858180	Intranasal immunization with outer membrane vesicles (OMV) protects against airway colonization and systemic infection with Acinetobacter baumannii.	The multidrug-resistant bacteria Acinetobacter baumannii is a major cause of hospital-associated infection; a vaccine could significantly reduce this burden. The aim was to develop a clinically relevant model of A. baumannii respiratory tract infection and to test the impact of different immunization routes on protective immunity provided by an outer membrane vesicle (OMV) vaccine.	2023 Jun	Sophie L Higham, Stephen Baker, Katie E Flight, Aishwarya Krishna, Paul Kellam, Stephen T Reece, John S Tregoning	J Infect
36606321	Interaction of lytic phage T1245 with antibiotics for enhancement of antibacterial and anti-biofilm efficacy against multidrug-resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>.	Biofilms associated with multidrug-resistant (MDR) <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> on medical devices remain a big clinical problem. Antibiotic susceptibility tests were performed with eight commonly employed antibiotics against clinical isolates. The effects of antibiotics in combination with well-characterized lytic phage T1245 were studied to assess their antibacterial and anti-biofilm efficacy. Ceftazidime, colistin, imipenem, and meropenem significantly reduced bacterial density up to approximately 80% when combined with phage T1245, compared with control. Phage T1245 in combination with ceftazidime, colistin, and meropenem at subinhibitory concentrations demonstrated significant reduction in biomass and bacterial viability of 3-day established biofilms, compared with antibiotic alone. In addition, electron microscopy further confirmed the disruption of biofilm structure and cell morphology upon treatment with phage T1245 and antibiotics, including ceftazidime, colistin, and meropenem. Combined treatment of phage T1245 with these antibiotics could be employed for the management of <i>A. baumannii</i> infections and eradication of the bacterial biofilms.	2022 Nov	Rosesathorn Soontarach, Ozioma Forstinus Nwabor, Supayang Piyawan Voravuthikunchai	Biofouling
36405598	Phage derived lytic peptides, a secret weapon against <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>-An <i>in silico</i> approach.	<i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> is a bacterial pathogen that is commonly associated with hospital-acquired illnesses. Antimicrobial drug resistance in <i>A. baumannii</i> includes several penicillin classes, first and second-generation cephalosporins, cephamycins, most aminoglycosides, chloramphenicol, and tetracyclines. The recent rise in multidrug-resistant <i>A. baumannii</i> strains has resulted in an increase in pneumoniae associated with ventilators, urinary tract infections associated with the catheter, and bloodstream infections, all of which have increased complications in treatment, cost of treatment, and death. Small compounds known as antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are known to have damaging effects on pathogenic bacteria. To determine their antimicrobial activity, AMPs are created from proteins acquired from various sources and evaluated <i>in vitro</i>. In the last phase of lytic cycle, bacteriophages release hydrolytic enzymes called endolysins that cleave the host's cell wall. Due to their superior potency and specificity compared to antibiotics, lysins are used as antibacterial agents. In the present study, different types of endolysin from phages of <i>A. baumannii</i> were selected based on an extensive literature survey. From the PhaLP database, the sequences of the selected lysins were retrieved in FASTA format and antimicrobial peptides were found among them. With the help of available bioinformatic tools, the anti-biofilm property, anti-fungal property, cell-penetrating property, and cellular toxicity of the antimicrobial peptides were determined. Out of the fourteen antimicrobial peptides found from the eight selected endolysins of <i>A. baumannii</i> specific phage, eight of them has anti-biofilm property, nine of them has anti-fungal property, five of them has cell-penetrating property and all of them are non-toxic.	2022	Abhishek Nandi, Ruchi Yadav, Aditi Singh	Front Med (Lausanne)
35810245	Assessment of physiological and electrochemical effects of a repurposed zinc dithiocarbamate complex on Acinetobacter baumannii biofilms.	Acinetobacter baumannii is an infectious agent of global proportion and concern, partly due to its proficiency in development of antibiotic resistance phenotypes and biofilm formation. Dithiocarbamates (DTC) have been identified as possible alternatives to the current antimicrobials. We report here the evaluation of several DTC-metal complexes against A. baumannii planktonic cells and biofilms. Among the DTC-metal complexes and DTCs tested, ZnL1 (N-methyl-1-phenyldithiocarbamato-S,S' Zn(II)), originally designed as an antitumor agent, is effective against biofilm forming A. baumannii. A MIC value of 12.5 µM, comparable to that of Gentamicin (5 µM) was measured for planktonic cells in tryptic soy broth. Spectroscopy, microscopy and biochemical analyses reveal cell membrane degradation and leakage after treatment with ZnL1. Bioelectrochemical analyses show that ZnL1 reduces biofilm formation and decreases extracellular respiration of pre-formed biofilms, as corroborated by microscopic analyses. Due to the affinity of Zn to cells and the metal chelating nature of L1 ligand, we hypothesize ZnL1 could alter metalloprotein functions in the membranes of A. baumannii cells, leading to altered redox balance. Results indicate that the DTC-Zn metal complex is an effective antimicrobial agent against early A. baumannii biofilms under laboratory conditions.	2022 Jul	Qing Yang, Kayode Olaifa, Fartisincha P Andrew, Peter A Ajibade, Obinna M Ajunwa, Enrico Marsili	Sci Rep

34825848	Association of capsular polysaccharide locus 2 with prognosis of <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> bacteraemia.	<i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> causes healthcare-associated infections worldwide. Capsular polysaccharide (CPS) is shown an important virulence factor of <i>A. baumannii</i> both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. Capsule locus 2 (KL2) for CPS is the most common KL type and is associated with carbapenem resistance. It is unclear whether KL2 is related to the clinical outcome of invasive <i>A. baumannii</i> infection. Here we had followed patients with <i>A. baumannii</i> bacteraemia prospectively between 2009 and 2014. One-third of the unduplicated blood isolates were randomly selected each year for microbiological and clinical studies. The KL2 gene cluster was identified using polymerase chain reaction. A total of 148 patients were enrolled randomly. Eighteen isolates (12.2%) carried KL2, and 130 isolates (87.8%) didn't. Compared with non-KL2 isolates, KL2 isolates had significantly higher resistance to imipenem, sulbactam, and tigecycline. Compared with the non-KL group, in the KL2 group, the hospital stay before development of bacteraemia was longer (<i>P</i> < 0.001), a higher percentage had pneumonia (<i>P</i> = 0.004), and the white blood cell count was lower (<i>P</i> = 0.03). Infection with KL2 <i>A. baumannii</i> predicted mortality (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 2.03; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.09-3.78; <i>P</i> = 0.03), independently of the Pitt bacteraemia score (aHR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.23-1.46; <i>P</i> < 0.001) and leucopenia (aHR, 2.16; 95% CI, 1.30-3.57; <i>P</i> = 0.003). Thrombocytopenia contributed to the effect of KL2 on mortality in bacteraemia (Sobel test <i>P</i> = 0.01). Large-scale studies are warranted to confirm these findings and the underlying mechanisms deserve further investigation.	2022 Dec	Jia-Ling Yang, Chia-Jui Yang, Yu-Chung Chuang, Wang-Huei Sheng, Yee-Chun Chen, Shan-Chwen Chang	Emerg Microbes Infect

35773283	Comparative genomics of Acinetobacter baumannii and therapeutic bacteriophages from a patient undergoing phage therapy.	In 2016, a 68-year-old patient with a disseminated multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii infection was successfully treated using lytic bacteriophages. Here we report the genomes of the nine phages used for treatment and three strains of A. baumannii isolated prior to and during treatment. The phages used in the initial treatment are related, T4-like myophages. Analysis of 19 A. baumannii isolates collected before and during phage treatment shows that resistance to the T4-like phages appeared two days following the start of treatment. We generate complete genomic sequences for three A. baumannii strains (TP1, TP2 and TP3) collected before and during treatment, supporting a clonal relationship. Furthermore, we use strain TP1 to select for increased resistance to five of the phages in vitro, and identify mutations that are also found in phage-insensitive isolates TP2 and TP3 (which evolved in vivo during phage treatment). These results support that in vitro investigations can produce results that are relevant to the in vivo environment.	2022 Jun	Mei Liu, Adriana Hernandez-Morales, James Clark, Tram Le, Biswajit Biswas, Kimberly A Bishop-Lilly, Matthew Henry, Javier Quinones, Logan J Voegtly, Regina Z Cer, Theron Hamilton, Robert T Schooley, Scott Salka, Ry Young, Jason J Gill	Nat Commun
36402866	Vaccination with a combination of planktonic and biofilm virulence factors confers protection against carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii strains.	Acinetobacter baumannii is a multi-drug resistant pathogen with the ability to switch between planktonic and biofilm phenotypes. Although there is no vaccine against A. baumannii infections, many attempts have been made to develop vaccines using planktonic or biofilm antigens. To cover the different phenotypes of A. baumannii during growth and attachment, we combined planktonic upregulated antigens of iron receptors with biofilm upregulated antigens of pilus rods and evaluated immune responses and protective efficacies of the combined vaccine using lethal and sub-lethal murine sepsis models. The results showed that the combined vaccine elicited high IgG antibody titers and conferred protection against lethal doses of two Carbapenem-resistant high adherent A. baumannii strains. Complete bacterial clearance from all the affected tissues of the mice challenged with A. baumannii was an excellent achievement with our quadrivalent immunogen. These results demonstrate both planktonic and biofilm antigens are important during antigen selection for vaccine design.	2022 Nov	Fatemeh Ramezanalizadeh, Iraj Rasooli, Parviz Owlia, Shakiba Darvish Alipour Astaneh, Raziyeh Abdolhamidi	Sci Rep
35889132	Sequence-Specific Electrochemical Genosensor for Rapid Detection of <i>bla</i><sub>OXA-51-like</sub> Gene in <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>.	Acinetobacter baumannii (A. baumannii) are phenotypically indistinguishable from the Acinetobacter calcoaceticus−A. baumannii (ACB) complex members using routine laboratory methods. Early diagnosis plays an important role in controlling A. baumannii infections and this could be assisted by the development of a rapid, yet sensitive diagnostic test. In this study, we developed an enzyme-based electrochemical genosensor for asymmetric PCR (aPCR) amplicon detection of the blaOXA-51-like gene in A. baumannii. A. baumanniiblaOXA-51-like gene PCR primers were designed, having the reverse primer modified at the 5′ end with FAM. A blaOXA-51-like gene sequence-specific biotin labelled capture probe was designed and immobilized using a synthetic oligomer (FAM-labelled) deposited on the working electrode of a streptavidin-modified, screen-printed carbon electrode (SPCE). The zot gene was used as an internal control with biotin and FAM labelled as forward and reverse primers, respectively. The blaOXA-51-like gene was amplified using asymmetric PCR (aPCR) to generate single-stranded amplicons that were detected using the designed SPCE. The amperometric current response was detected with a peroxidase-conjugated, anti-fluorescein antibody. The assay was tested using reference and clinical A. baumannii strains and other nosocomial bacteria. The analytical sensitivity of the assay at the genomic level and bacterial cell level was 0.5 pg/mL (1.443 µA) and 103 CFU/mL, respectively. The assay was 100% specific and sensitive for A. baumannii. Based on accelerated stability performance, the developed genosensor was stable for 1.6 years when stored at 4 °C and up to 28 days at >25 °C. The developed electrochemical genosensor is specific and sensitive and could be useful for rapid, accurate diagnosis of A. baumannii infections even in temperate regions.	2022 Jul	Swarnaletchumi Kanapathy, Godwin Attah Obande, Candy Chuah, Rafidah Hanim Shueb, Chan Yean Yean, Kirnpal Kaur Banga Singh	Microorganisms
36978490	The Antimicrobial Peptide Octopromycin Suppresses Biofilm Formation and Quorum Sensing in <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>.	<i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> is an opportunistic bacterial pathogen that causes severe infections in immunocompromised individuals. <i>A. baumannii</i> forms biofilm and produces extracellular matrix, which supports bacteria to survive under harsh conditions and be resistant to antibacterial treatments. In the present study, we investigated the biofilm and quorum-sensing inhibitory effects of antimicrobial peptide, octopromycin in <i>A. baumannii</i>. Field emission-scanning electron microscopy results clearly showed significantly reduced biofilm mass and caused a collapse in biofilm architecture at the minimum inhibitory concentration (50 µg/mL) and minimum bactericidal concentration (200 µg/mL) of octopromycin. Antibiotic-resistant persister cells of <i>A. baumannii</i> were successfully killed by octopromycin treatment, and it inhibited violacein production in <i>Chromobacterium violaceum</i> in a concentration-dependent manner. Octopromycin also inhibited alginate production, surface movements (swarming and swimming), and twitching motility of <i>A. baumannnii</i>, confirming its anti-quorum-sensing activity. Multiple metabolic pathways, two-component regulation systems, quorum-sensing, and antibiotic synthesis-related pathways in <i>A. baumannii</i> biofilms were strongly affected by octopromycin treatment. The collective findings indicate that the antibacterial peptide octopromycin may control <i>A. baumannii</i> biofilms through multi-target interactions. Octopromycin could be a desirable therapeutic option for the prevention and control of <i>A. baumannii</i> infections.	2023 Mar	Dinusha Chathurangi Rajapaksha, Shan Lakmal Edirisinghe, Chamilani Nikapitiya, Ilson Whang, Mahanama De Zoysa	Antibiotics (Basel)
35290154	Concurrent pigeon paramyxovirus-1 and <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> infection in a fatal case of pneumonia.	Pigeon paramyxovirus type 1 (PPMV-1), an antigenic variant of avian paramyxovirus type 1 (APMV-1), mainly infects pigeons. PPMV-1 genotype VI is the dominant genotype infecting pigeons in China. Human infection of avian paramyxovirus was rarely reported, and usually developed mild symptoms, such as conjunctivitis. We detected PPMV-1 in the lower respiratory sample from a fatal case with severe pneumonia; this patient aged 64 years presented cough, fever, and haemoptysis for 8 days and was admitted to hospital on Dec 26, 2020. He developed acute respiratory distress syndrome and sepsis in the following days and died of multiple organ failure on Jan 7, 2021. Sputum and blood culture reported multidrug-resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> (ABA) for samples collected on days 22 and 19 post-illness, respectively. However, clinical metagenomic sequencing further reported PPMV-1 besides ABA in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. The PPMV-1 genome showed 99.21% identity with a Chinese strain and belonged to VI genotype by BLAST analysis. Multiple basic amino acids were observed at the cleavage site of F protein (113RKKRF117), which indicated high virulence of this PPMV-1 strain to poultry. The patient had close contact with pigeons before his illness, and PPMV-1 nucleic acid was detected from the pigeon feather. PPMV antibody was also detected in the patient serum 20 days after illness. In conclusion, concurrent PPMV-1 genotype VI.2.1.1.2.2 and ABA infection were identified in a fatal pneumonia case, and cross-species transmission of PPMV-1 may occur between infected pigeons and the human being.	2022 Dec	Xiaohui Zou, Lijun Suo, Yiming Wang, Hongyun Cao, Shengrui Mu, Chao Wu, Lizhen Yan, Xiaowei Qi, Jianwei Lu, Binghuai Lu, Yanyan Fan, Hui Li, Lixue Huang, Lili Ren, Bo Liu, Bin Cao	Emerg Microbes Infect
37017535	Investigation of Peptidoglycan-Associated Lipoprotein of <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> and Its Interaction with Fibronectin To Find Its Therapeutic Potential.	Acinetobacter baumannii causes hospital-acquired infections and is responsible for high mortality and morbidity. The interaction of this bacterium with the host is critical in bacterial pathogenesis and infection. Here, we report the interaction of peptidoglycan-associated lipoprotein (PAL) of A. baumannii with host fibronectin (FN) to find its therapeutic potential. The proteome of A. baumannii was explored in the host-pathogen interaction database to filter out the PAL of the bacterial outer membrane that interacts with the host's FN protein. This interaction was confirmed experimentally using purified recombinant PAL and pure FN protein. To investigate the pleiotropic role of PAL protein, different biochemical assays using wild-type PAL and PAL mutants were performed. The result showed that PAL mediates bacterial pathogenesis, adherence, and invasion in host pulmonary epithelial cells and has a role in the biofilm formation, bacterial motility, and membrane integrity of bacteria. All of the results suggest that PAL's interaction with FN plays a vital role in host-cell interaction. In addition, the PAL protein also interacts with Toll-like receptor 2 and MARCO receptor, which suggests the role of PAL protein in innate immune responses. We have also investigated the therapeutic potential of this protein for vaccine and therapeutic design. Using reverse vaccinology, PAL's potential epitopes were filtered out that exhibit binding potential with host major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I), MHC-II, and B cells, suggesting that PAL protein is a potential vaccine target. The immune simulation showed that PAL protein could elevate innate and adaptive immune response with the generation of memory cells and would have subsequent potential to eliminate bacterial infection. Therefore, the present study highlights the interaction ability of a novel host-pathogen interacting partner (PAL-FN) and uncovers its therapeutic potential to combat infection caused by A. baumannii.	2023 May	Vandana Solanki, Monalisa Tiwari, Vishvanath Tiwari	Infect Immun

36625664	Development of Nanoparticle Adaptation Phenomena in Acinetobacter baumannii: Physiological Change and Defense Response.	The present work describes the evolution of a resistance phenotype to a multitargeting antimicrobial agent, namely, silver nanoparticles (nanosilver; NAg), in the globally prevalent bacterial pathogen Acinetobacter baumannii. The Gram-negative bacterium has recently been listed as a critical priority pathogen requiring novel treatment options by the World Health Organization. Through prolonged exposure to the important antimicrobial nanoparticle, the bacterium developed mutations in genes that encode the protein subunits of organelle structures that are involved in cell-to-surface attachment as well as in a cell envelope capsular polysaccharide synthesis-related gene. These mutations are potentially correlated with stable physiological changes in the biofilm growth behavior and with an evident protective effect against oxidative stress, most likely as a feature of toxicity defense. We further report a different adaptation response of A. baumannii to the cationic form of silver (Ag<sup>+</sup>). The bacterium developed a tolerance phenotype to Ag<sup>+</sup>, which was correlated with an indicative surge in respiratory activity and changes in cell morphology, of which these are reported characteristics of tolerant bacterial populations. The findings regarding adaptation phenomena to NAg highlight the risks of the long-term use of the nanoparticle on a priority pathogen. The findings urge the implementation of strategies to overcome bacterial NAg adaptation, to better elucidate the toxicity mechanisms of the nanoparticle, and preserve the efficacy of the potent alternative antimicrobial agent in this era of antimicrobial resistance. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Several recent studies have reported on the development of bacterial resistance to broad-spectrum antimicrobial silver nanoparticles (nanosilver; NAg). NAg is currently one of the most important alternative antimicrobial agents. However, no studies have yet established whether Acinetobacter baumannii, a globally prevalent nosocomial pathogen, can develop resistance to the nanoparticle. The study herein describes how a model strain of A. baumannii with no inherent silver resistance determinants developed resistance to NAg, following prolonged exposure. The stable physiological changes are correlated with mutations detected in the bacterium genome. These mutations render the bacterium capable of proliferating at a toxic NAg concentration. It was also found that A. baumannii developed a "slower-to-kill" tolerance trait to Ag<sup>+</sup>, which highlights the unique antimicrobial activities between the nanoparticulate and the ionic forms of silver. Despite the proven efficacy of NAg, the observation of NAg resistance in A. baumannii emphasises the potential risks of the repeated overuse of this agent on a priority pathogen.	2023 Feb	Oliver McNeilly, Riti Mann, Max Laurence Cummins, Steven P Djordjevic, Mehrad Hamidian, Cindy Gunawan	Microbiol Spectr
36375774	The evolution of carbapenem resistance determinants and major epidemiological lineages among carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii isolates in Germany, 2010-2019.	The aim of this study was to investigate and compare the molecular epidemiology and carbapenem resistance determinants in clinical Acinetobacter baumannii isolates collected during four multicentre surveillance studies conducted by the Paul-Ehrlich-Society for Infection Therapy. Isolates were collected prospectively from hospital in-patients at 17 medical centres in Germany over four periods of three- to six-months starting in October of each of 2010, 2013, 2016 and 2019. Species identification was performed by MALDI-TOF, gyrB multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and detection of the intrinsic bla<sub>OXA-51-like</sub> gene. Minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined by broth microdilution. The prevalence of carbapenemase-encoding genes was investigated by OXA-multiplex PCR and whole-genome sequencing. Molecular epidemiology was examined by rep-PCR and core-genome multi-locus sequence typing. A total of 302 A. baumannii isolates were collected. Resistance to imipenem and/or meropenem was detected in 58 isolates (19.2%) from 14 centres. The proportion of carbapenem-resistant isolates increased from 21.3% in 2010 to 33.3% in 2013, and then decreased to 13.8% in 2016 and 12.3% in 2019. Forty-six of these isolates were associated with the international clonal lineage IC2 and five with IC1. The most prevalent carbapenemase gene detected was bla<sub>OXA-23-like</sub> (n=51). Further carbapenem-resistance determinants were bla<sub>OXA-40-like</sub> (n=1), bla<sub>OXA-58-like</sub> (n=3) and bla<sub>NDM-1</sub> (n=2). In one isolate, ISAba1 was detected upstream of bla<sub>OXA-51-like</sub>. In conclusion, IC2 was the most prevalent clonal lineage detected in this study. Interestingly, in Germany, carbapenem resistance seems to have decreased in A. baumannii between 2013 and 2019.	2022	Esther Wohlfarth, Michael Kresken, Paul G Higgins, Danuta Stefanik, Julia Wille, Dieter Hafner, Barbara Körber-Irrgang, Harald Seifert, Study Group “Antimicrobial Resistance” of the Paul-Ehrlich-Society for Infection Therapy	Int J Antimicrob Agents

36040021	Essential Fitness Repertoire of Staphylococcus aureus during Co-infection with Acinetobacter baumannii <i>In Vivo</i>.	Staphylococcus aureus represents a major human pathogen that is frequently involved in polymicrobial infections. However, the prevalence and role of co-infectious microbes on the pathogenesis and fitness essentiality of S. aureus <i>in vivo</i> remain largely unknown. In this study, we firstly performed a retrospective surveillance of 760 clinical samples and revealed a notable predominance of co-infection with S. aureus and Acinetobacter baumannii. The high-density S. aureus transposon mutant library coupled to transposon insertion sequencing (Tn-Seq) further identified a core set of genes enriched in metabolism of inorganic ions, amino acids, and carbohydrates, which are essential for infection and tissue colonization of S. aureus in the murine systemic infection model. Notably, we revealed a differential requirement of fitness factors for S. aureus in tissue-specific (liver and kidney) and infection-type-specific manner (mono- and co-infection). Co-infection with A. baumannii dramatically altered the fitness requirements of S. aureus <i>in vivo</i>; 49% of the mono-infection fitness genes in S. aureus strain Newman were converted to non-essential, and the functionality of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters was significantly elicited during co-infection. Furthermore, the number of genes essential during co-infection (503) outnumbers the genes essential during mono-infection (362). In addition, the roles of 3 infection-type-specific genes in S. aureus during mono-infection or co-infection with A. baumannii were validated with competitive experiments <i>in vivo</i>. Our data indicated a high incidence and clinical relevance of S. aureus and A. baumannii co-infection, and provided novel insights into establishing antimicrobial regimens to control co-infections. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Polymicrobial infections are widespread in clinical settings, which potentially correlate with increased infection severity and poor clinical outcomes. Staphylococcus aureus is a formidable human pathogen that causes a variety of diseases in polymicrobial nature. Co-infection and interaction of S. aureus have been described with limited pathogens, mainly including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans, and influenza A virus. Thus far, the prevalence and role of co-infectious microbes on the pathogenesis and fitness essentiality of S. aureus <i>in vivo</i> remain largely unknown. Understanding the polymicrobial composition and interaction, from a community and genome-wide perspective, is thus crucial to shed light on S. aureus pathogenesis strategy. Here, our findings demonstrated, for the first time, that a high incidence rate and clinical relevance of co-infection was caused by S. aureus and Acinetobacter baumannii, illustrating the importance of polymicrobial nature in investigating S. aureus pathogenesis. The infection-type-specific genes likely serve as potential therapeutic targets to control S. aureus infections, either in mono- or co-infection situation, providing novel insights into the development of antimicrobial regimens to control co-infections.	2022 Oct	Gang Li, Wei Shen, Yali Gong, Ming Li, Xiaocai Rao, Qian Liu, Yanlan Yu, Jing Zhou, Keting Zhu, Mengmeng Yuan, Weilong Shang, Yi Yang, Shuguang Lu, Jing Wang, Yan Zhao	mSystems
36140032	Minocycline and the SPR741 Adjuvant Are an Efficacious Antibacterial Combination for <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> Infections.	Antibiotic resistance, when it comes to bacterial infections, is not a problem that is going to disappear anytime soon. With the lack of larger investment in novel antibiotic research and the ever-growing increase of resistant isolates amongst the ESKAPEE pathogens (<i>Enterobacter cloacae</i>, <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>, <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i>, <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>, <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>, <i>Enterococcus</i> sp., and <i>Escherichia coli</i>), it is inevitable that more and more infections caused by extensively drug-resistant (XDR) and pandrug-resistant (PDR) strains will arise. One strategy to counteract the growing threat is to use antibiotic adjuvants, a drug class that on its own lacks significant antibiotic activity, but when mixed with another antibiotic, can potentiate increased killing of bacteria. Antibiotic adjuvants have various mechanisms of action, but polymyxins and polymyxin-like molecules can disrupt the Gram-negative outer membrane and allow other drugs better penetration into the bacterial periplasm and cytoplasm. Previously, we showed that SPR741 had this adjuvant effect with regard to rifampin; however, rifampin is often not used clinically because of easily acquired resistance. To find additional, appropriate clinical partners for SPR741 with respect to pulmonary and wound infections, we investigated tetracyclines and found a previously undocumented synergy with minocycline <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> in murine models of infection.	2022 Sep	Yonas A Alamneh, Vlado Antonic, Brittany Garry, Michael J Pucci, Rania Abu-Taleb, Jonathan P Shearer, Samandra T Demons, Derese Getnet, Brett E Swierczewski, Troy Lister, Daniel V Zurawski	Antibiotics (Basel)
35948125	Comparison of pneumonia and nonpneumonia-related Acinetobacter baumannii complex bacteremia: A single-center retrospective study.	Acinetobacter baumannii complex (ABC) is a group of increasingly prevalent opportunistic pathogens that cause a variety of life-threatening nosocomial infections, especially in the intensive care unit (ICU). This study assessed the differences between pneumonia- and non-pneumonia-related ABC bacteremia and possible independent risk factors for 30-day mortality.	2023 May	Jun Xu, Yulu Xu, Xia Zheng	Am J Infect Control
36194009	The DdrR Coregulator of the Acinetobacter baumannii Mutagenic DNA Damage Response Potentiates UmuDAb Repression of Error-Prone Polymerases.	Acinetobacter baumannii strain 17978 is an opportunistic pathogen with a unique DNA damage repair response that lacks the LexA repressor but induces ~150 genes after DNA damage. It uses the UmuD homolog UmuDAb and the small protein DdrR, unique to Acinetobacter, to repress multiple horizontally acquired <i>umuDC</i> error-prone polymerase genes through an unknown mechanism. We used reverse transcription-quantitative PCR and immunoblotting to elucidate UmuDAb regulatory requirements and DdrR contributions to the corepression of this specialized regulon. Mutations in the putative UmuDAb helix-turn-helix (HTH) domain could not repress the expression of the UmuDAb/DdrR regulon. A <i>ddrR</i> insertion mutation in these HTH mutant backgrounds produced even greater derepression of the regulon, suggesting that DdrR exerts an additional level of control over this mutagenic response. These <i>ddrR</i> HTH mutant A. baumannii cells overexpressed UmuDAb, cleaving it after treatment with the DNA-damaging agent mitomycin C. This showed that DdrR was not required for UmuDAb self-cleavage and that UmuDAb repression and self-cleavage actions were independent. An uncleavable <i>umuDAb</i> mutant with an A-to-Y change at position 83 (A83Y) could neither induce the UmuDAb/DdrR regulon nor conduct SOS mutagenesis. However, a prophage-encoded <i>umuDrumB</i> operon was still partially induced after DNA damage in this mutant. Surprisingly, that prophage's putative repressor was dispensable for prophage-encoded <i>umuDrumB</i> induction, implying another repressor's involvement. This study revealed that UmuDAb behaves like LexA, requiring an N-terminal HTH motif for repression and C-terminal self-cleavage for gene induction and subsequent SOS mutagenesis, and DdrR cooperates with it to exert an additional level of repressive control on this pathogen's mutagenic response to DNA damage. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Acinetobacter baumannii is a nosocomial pathogen that acquires antibiotic resistance genes through conjugative transfer and carries out a robust mutagenic DNA damage response. After exposure to conditions typically encountered in health care settings, such as antibiotics, UV light, and desiccation, this species induces error-prone UmuD'<sub>2</sub>C polymerases. This mutagenic capability increases A. baumannii survival and virulence and is regulated by the UmuDAb/DdrR corepressor system unique to the Acinetobacter genus. Our study has revealed that the DdrR protein provides an additional layer of control in preventing mutagenic polymerase expression by enhancing UmuDAb repression actions. Understanding these repressors could lead to new drug targets, as multidrug resistance in hospital-acquired infections has decreased treatment options, with limited new drugs being developed.	2022 Nov	Deborah Cook, Mollee D Flannigan, Belinda V Candra, Kaylee D Compton, Janelle M Hare	J Bacteriol

35899052	Zidebactam restores sulbactam susceptibility against carbapenem-resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> isolates.	Carbapenems are commonly used to treat infections caused by multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria. Unfortunately, carbapenem resistance is increasingly reported in many gram-negative bacteria, especially <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>. Diazabicyclooctane (DBO) β-lactamase inhibitors, such as avibactam (AVI), when combined with sulbactam successfully restore sulbactam susceptibility against certain carbapenem-resistant <i>A. baumannii</i> (CRAB) isolates. In the present study, we tested zidebactam, a novel DBO with an additional mechanism of action, in combination with sulbactam against CRAB isolates, including strains that exhibited resistance against sulbactam/avibactam combination. A panel of 43 geographically and genetically distinct CRAB isolates recovered from different hospitals and containing different mechanisms of resistance were included in the present study. We also tested three reference strains (AB0057, AB5075, and AYE). Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for sulbactam (range 0.12-512 mg/l) and sulbactam plus 4 mg/l zidebactam were performed using microdilution according to CLSI Standards. A decrease ≥2 dilutions in sulbactam MICs was observed in 84% of the isolates when tested in combination with zidebactam. The sulbactam/zidebactam combination was able to restore sulbactam susceptibility in 91% of the isolates, including isolates that were resistant to sulbactam/avibactam combination. These data encouraged us to further explore sulbactam/zidebactam in other experimental models especially against CRAB isolates resistant to other DBOs.	2022	Jose Cedano, Michelle Baez, Fernando Pasteran, Sabrina Daiana Montaña, Grace Ra, Venjaminne Fua, Alejandra Corso, Marcelo E Tolmasky, Robert A Bonomo, María Soledad Ramírez	Front Cell Infect Microbiol
36145435	Faecal Carriage of Carbapenem-Resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>: Comparison to Clinical Isolates from the Same Period (2017-2019).	Increasing prevalence of A. baumannii was found in the faecal samples of inpatients without infection caused by A. baumannii (0.15%; 55/7806). The aim of the study was to determine whether there is a relationship between the clinical strains and the increased faecal occurrence. Characteristics of faecal and clinical isolates were compared between 2017 and 2019, and the direction of causality was assessed by Granger causality tests. In the case of the antibiotic resistance, faecal carriage of carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAb) was Granger-caused by prevalence of CRAb in inpatients (F = 15.84, p < 0.001), but inpatient prevalence was not Granger-caused by CRAb faecal carriage (F = 0.03, p = 0.855). Whole genomes of 16 faecal isolates were sequenced by Illumina MiSeq; cgMLST types were determined. In faecal isolates, the occurrence of carbapenem resistance was lower than among the clinical isolates from the same period; only blaOXA-72 harbouring ST636 and ST492 were detected, and the blaOXA-23 harbouring ST2 and ST49 strains previously dominant in clinical isolates were absent. Carriage of blaOXA-72 was linked to pMAL-1-like and pA105-2-like plasmids in ST636 and ST492 isolates, respectively, both in clinical and faecal isolates. The new ST636 and ST492 strains may colonise the gut microbiota of the patients, which thus may play a role as a reservoir.	2022 Sep	Bence Balázs, Zoltán Tóth, József Bálint Nagy, László Majoros, Ákos Tóth, Gábor Kardos	Pathogens
36431892	Glycosphingolipids (GSLs) from <i>Sphingomonas paucimobilis</i> Increase the Efficacy of Liposome-Based Nanovaccine against <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>-Associated Pneumonia in Immunocompetent and Immunocompromised Mice.	Due to the high propensity of drug resistance in <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>, the number of currently available therapeutic drugs has become very limited. Thus, it becomes incredibly important to prepare an effective vaccine formulation capable of eliciting an effective immune response against <i>A. baumannii</i>. In this study, we prepared a liposomal vaccine formulation bearing glycosphingolipids (GSLs) from <i>Sphingomonas paucimobilis</i> and loaded with the whole cell antigen (WCAgs-GSLs-liposomes) of <i>A. baumannii</i>. The immune-stimulating potential and prophylactic efficacy of WCAgs-GSLs-liposomes were compared with those of WCAgs-liposomes (without GSLs) or free WCAgs in both immunocompetent and immunodeficient mice. The efficacy of vaccine formulations was determined by analyzing antibody titer, cytokine levels, and survival studies in the immunized mice. The findings revealed that vaccination with WCAgs-GSLs-liposomes stimulated a greater secretion of antibodies and cytokines, higher lymphocyte proliferation, and increased expression of the co-stimulatory molecules. Anti-sera from WCAgs-GSLs-liposomes-immunized mice remarkably reduced the biofilm formation by <i>A. baumannii</i>. Most importantly, WCAgs-GSLs-liposomes-vaccinated mice demonstrated a higher defiance against the pathogen, as compared to the immunizations with WCAgs-liposomes (without GSLs) or free WCAgs. Immunocompetent mice immunized with WCAgs-GSLs-liposomes showed a 100% survival rate, while those immunized with WCAgs-liposomes exhibited a 60% survival rate. The protective effect of WCAgs-GSLs-liposomes was also found to be higher in immunocompromised mice, as the immunized mice showed a 50% survival rate, which was greater than the 20% survival rate of those immunized with WCAgs-liposomes. The survival data was also supported by the findings of bacterial load and histological analysis that substantiated the greatest prophylactic potential of the WCAgs-GSLs-liposomes. These findings recommend that WCAgs-GSLs-liposomes may be reckoned as a prospective vaccine to protect the persons against <i>A. baumannii</i> infection.	2022 Nov	Masood Alam Khan, Khaled S Allemailem, Hamzah Maswadeh, Hina Younus	Molecules

36308002	Clinical and genomic analysis of virulence-related genes in bloodstream infections caused by <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>.	<i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> has emerged as a common cause of bloodstream infections, which is associated with high mortality and long periods of hospitalization. To advance the medical care of our patients, the study was designed to identify microbial characteristics associated with poor clinical outcomes. A collection of 32 <i>A. baumannii</i> bloodstream isolates with diverse genetic backgrounds (as determined by multilocus sequence typing) was studied. These isolates were recovered by unique patients (18 males, 14 females; age range: 17 days to 87 years) between 2011 and 2018. A sequential screening approach (cross-referencing analyses using different endpoints) was used to identify isolates with the best correlation between bacterial virulence and clinical prognosis. Isolates associated with more rapid <i>in vitro</i> growth rate, shorter median survival time in pre-clinical infection models, and hospital mortality were selected as candidates for high virulence, while those with opposite characteristics were selected as controls with low virulence. Whole genome sequencing was undertaken in the most promising clinical isolates. We found five virulence genes (beta-hemolysin/cytolysin, Cpi-1a + Cpi-1 (SPI-1 like), enhanced entry proteins, FbpABC, Paa) and 1 secretory system (T6SS) only present in a highly virulent isolate (AB23), compared to a low virulence control isolate (AB6). These genetic elements could be associated with the poor prognosis of <i>A. baumannii</i> bacteraemia and further investigations are warranted.	2022 Dec	Bing Bai, Brianna M Eales, Wei Huang, Kimberly R Ledesma, Paul R Merlau, Guiqiu Li, Zhijian Yu, Vincent H Tam	Virulence
36054235	Lipocalin-2 is an essential component of the innate immune response to Acinetobacter baumannii infection.	Acinetobacter baumannii is an opportunistic pathogen and an emerging global health threat. Within healthcare settings, major presentations of A. baumannii include bloodstream infections and ventilator-associated pneumonia. The increased prevalence of ventilated patients during the COVID-19 pandemic has led to a rise in secondary bacterial pneumonia caused by multidrug resistant (MDR) A. baumannii. Additionally, due to its MDR status and the lack of antimicrobial drugs in the development pipeline, the World Health Organization has designated carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii to be its priority critical pathogen for the development of novel therapeutics. To better inform the design of new treatment options, a comprehensive understanding of how the host contains A. baumannii infection is required. Here, we investigate the innate immune response to A. baumannii by assessing the impact of infection on host gene expression using NanoString technology. The transcriptional profile observed in the A. baumannii infected host is characteristic of Gram-negative bacteremia and reveals expression patterns consistent with the induction of nutritional immunity, a process by which the host exploits the availability of essential nutrient metals to curtail bacterial proliferation. The gene encoding for lipocalin-2 (Lcn2), a siderophore sequestering protein, was the most highly upregulated during A. baumannii bacteremia, of the targets assessed, and corresponds to robust LCN2 expression in tissues. Lcn2-/- mice exhibited distinct organ-specific gene expression changes including increased transcription of genes involved in metal sequestration, such as S100A8 and S100A9, suggesting a potential compensatory mechanism to perturbed metal homeostasis. In vitro, LCN2 inhibits the iron-dependent growth of A. baumannii and induces iron-regulated gene expression. To elucidate the role of LCN2 in infection, WT and Lcn2-/- mice were infected with A. baumannii using both bacteremia and pneumonia models. LCN2 was not required to control bacterial growth during bacteremia but was protective against mortality. In contrast, during pneumonia Lcn2-/- mice had increased bacterial burdens in all organs evaluated, suggesting that LCN2 plays an important role in inhibiting the survival and dissemination of A. baumannii. The control of A. baumannii infection by LCN2 is likely multifactorial, and our results suggest that impairment of iron acquisition by the pathogen is a contributing factor. Modulation of LCN2 expression or modifying the structure of LCN2 to expand upon its ability to sequester siderophores may thus represent feasible avenues for therapeutic development against this pathogen.	2022 Sep	Jessica R Sheldon, Lauren E Himmel, Dillon E Kunkle, Andrew J Monteith, K Nichole Maloney, Eric P Skaar	PLoS Pathog
35998891	Biomimetic Neutrophil Nanotoxoids Elicit Potent Immunity against <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> in Multiple Models of Infection.	<i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> is a leading cause of antibiotic-resistant nosocomial infections with high mortality rates, yet there is currently no clinically approved vaccine formulation. During the onset of <i>A. baumannii</i> infection, neutrophils are the primary responders and play a major role in resisting the pathogen. Here, we design a biomimetic nanotoxoid for antivirulence vaccination by using neutrophil membrane-coated nanoparticles to safely capture secreted <i>A. baumannii</i> factors. Vaccination with the nanotoxoid formulation rapidly mobilizes innate immune cells and promotes pathogen-specific adaptive immunity. In murine models of pneumonia, septicemia, and superficial wound infection, immunization with the nanovaccine offers significant protection, improving survival and reducing signs of acute inflammation. Lower bacterial burdens are observed in vaccinated animals regardless of the infection route. Altogether, neutrophil nanotoxoids represent an effective platform for eliciting multivalent immunity to protect against multidrug-resistant <i>A. baumannii</i> in a wide range of disease conditions.	2022 Sep	Jiarong Zhou, Christian J Ventura, Yiyan Yu, Weiwei Gao, Ronnie H Fang, Liangfang Zhang	Nano Lett

36978447	Phenotypic and Genotypic Investigation of Carbapenem-Resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> in Maharaj Nakhon Si Thammarat Hospital, Thailand.	(1) Background: <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> is well known as a causative agent of severe hospital-acquired infections, especially in intensive care units. The present study characterised the genetic traits of biofilm-forming carbapenem-resistant <i>A. baumannii</i> (CRAB) clinical isolates. Additionally, this study determined the prevalence of biofilm-producing <i>A. baumannii</i> isolates from a tertiary care hospital and investigated the association of biofilms with the distribution of biofilm-related and antibiotic resistance-associated genotypes. (2) Methods: The 995 non-duplicate <i>A. baumannii</i> isolates were identified, and their susceptibilities to different antibiotics were determined using the disk diffusion method. Using the modified microtiter plate assay, the CRAB isolates were investigated for their biofilm formation ability. Hemolysin and protease activities were determined. CRABs were subjected to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays targeting <i>bla</i><sub>VIM</sub>, <i>bla</i><sub>NDM</sub>, <i>bla</i><sub>IMP</sub>, <i>bla</i><sub>OXA-23-like</sub>, <i>bla</i><sub>OXA-24-like</sub>, <i>bla</i><sub>OXA-51-like</sub>, <i>csu</i>E and <i>pga</i>B genes. Individual CRAB isolates were identified for their DNA fingerprint by repetitive element sequence-based (REP)-PCR. (3) Results: Among all <i>A. baumannii</i> isolates, 172 CRABs were identified. The major antibiotic resistance gene among the CRAB isolates was <i>bla</i><sub>OXA-51-like</sub> (100%). Ninety-nine isolates (57.56%) were biofilm producers. The most prevalent biofilm gene was <i>pga</i>B (79.65%), followed by <i>csu</i>E (76.74%). Evidence of virulence phenotypes revealed that all CRAB exhibited proteolytic activity; however, only four isolates (2.33%) were positive for the hemolytic-producing phenotype. REP-PCR showed that 172 CRAB isolates can be divided into 36-DNA fingerprint patterns. (4) Conclusions: The predominance of biofilm-producing CRAB isolates identified in this study is concerning. The characterisation of risk factors could aid in controlling the continual selection and spreading of the <i>A. baumannii</i> phenotype in hospitals, thereby improving patient care quality.	2023 Mar	Sirijan Santajit, Phuangthip Bhoopong, Thida Kong-Ngoen, Witawat Tunyong, Dararat Horpet, Wanfudhla Paehoh-Ele, Tasneem Zahedeng, Pornpan Pumirat, Nitat Sookrung, Woranich Hinthong, Nitaya Indrawattana	Antibiotics (Basel)

35670904	Identification of Antigenic Properties of Acinetobacter baumannii Proteins as Novel Putative Vaccine Candidates Using Reverse Vaccinology Approach.	Multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (A. baumannii) infections are becoming more prevalent all over the world. As a cost-effective and preventative method, vaccination seems to be required against this bacterium. In the present study, subtractive proteomics along with reverse vaccinology approaches was used to predict suitable therapeutics against A. baumannii. Using the Vaxign online tool, we studied over 35 genomes of A. baumannii strains and chose outer membrane and secreted proteins of A. baumannii 1656-2 as possible vaccine candidates. Then, investigations were performed on the immunogenicity, antigenic characteristics, physicochemical properties, B-cell and MHC class I, and MHC class II molecules epitope densities of proteins. After optimizing the codon of the proteins, the pcDNA3.1( +) expression construct was designed and the immunogenicity, allergenicity, and physicochemical properties of the vaccine construct were predicted. Hcp and OmpC proteins were predicted as extracellular and outer membrane proteins, respectively. These proteins interact with 10 other proteins to form a network of protein interactions with virulence properties. Immunoassays of Hcp and OmpC proteins showed antigenicity of 0.88 and 0.79, respectively. These proteins have 5 structural cell epitope points and 5 linear B epitope points. They are also able to bind to different HLA alleles of MCH class I/class II as selected immunogenic proteins and designed non-allergenic structures with solubility of 0.650 and immunogenicity score of 0.91. The results of this "in silico" study indicate high specificity and the development of a significant humoral and cellular immune response. It can be concluded that the Hcp and OmpC dual vaccine construct is one of the promising candidates against A. baumannii. The findings of this "in silico" study show excellent specificity and the emergence of a substantial humoral and cellular immune response. This is a computer-based study that needs to be tested in vitro and in vivo to corroborate the conclusions of the vaccine design procedures.	2022 Oct	Tohid Piri-Gharaghie, Abbas Doosti, Seyed Abbas Mirzaei	Appl Biochem Biotechnol
36951192	Natural antibodies mediate protection against Acinetobacter baumannii respiratory infections.	Acinetobacter baumannii causes a wide range of dangerous infections due to the emergence of pan-drug resistant strains. Therefore, there is a need for alternative therapeutics to treat these infections, including those targeting the host immune responses. However, immune responses, especially the humoral response against this pathogen, are poorly understood.	2023 Mar	Aminul Islam, Luis A Actis, Timothy J Wilson	J Infect Dis

37125467	Navigating Available Treatment Options for Carbapenem-Resistant Acinetobacter baumannii-calcoaceticus Complex Infections.	Carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii-calcoaceticus complex (CRAB) is one of the top-priority pathogens for new antibiotic development. Unlike other antibiotic-resistant threats, none of the available therapies have been shown to consistently reduce mortality or improve patient outcomes in clinical trials. Antibiotic combination therapy is routinely used in clinical practice; however, the preferred combination has not been defined. This narrative review focuses on evidence-based solutions for the treatment of invasive CRAB infections. We dissect the promise and perils of traditional agents used in combination, such as colistin, sulbactam, and the tetracyclines, and offer clinical pearls based on our interpretation of the available data. Next, we investigate the merits of newly developed β-lactam agents like cefiderocol and sulbactam-durlobactam, which have demonstrated contrasting results in recent randomized clinical trials. The review concludes with the authors' perspective on the evolving treatment landscape for CRAB infections, which is complicated by limited clinical data, imperfect treatment options, and a need for future clinical trials. We propose that effective treatment for CRAB infections requires a personalized approach that incorporates host factors, the site of infection, pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic principles, local molecular epidemiology of CRAB isolates, and careful interpretation of antibiotic susceptibility testing results. In most clinical scenarios, a dose-optimized, sulbactam-based regimen is recommended with the addition of at least one other in vitro active agent. Should sulbactam-durlobactam receive regulatory approval, recommendations will need to be re-evaluated with the most recent evidence.	2023 May	Ryan K Shields, David L Paterson, Pranita D Tamma	Clin Infect Dis
36622150	Protective Capacity of Monoclonal Antibodies against Acinetobacter baumannii K9 Capsular Polysaccharide.	Acinetobacter baumannii is an antibiotic-resistant opportunistic pathogen, one of the main causes of hospital infections. There is an urgent need for the development of therapy strategies which are not based on antibiotics. Hybridoma technology was used to obtain monoclonal antibodies. The antibodies were characterized by enzyme immunoassay and fluorescence microscopy according to their ability to opsonize A. baumannii and to protect model animals from infection upon intraperitoneal and pulmonary injection. Monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), IgG, against the K9 capsular polysaccharide (CPS) of A. baumannii were prepared using a glycoconjugate, synthesized by squaric-acid chemistry, consisting of two CPS K9 monomer units and a carrier protein. The MAbs were highly specific, stained the bacterial surface, allowed detection of A. baumannii in infected lung tissue, effectively opsonized the bacteria at nanogram concentrations (up to 1.5 ng/mL for CPS-407), and demonstrated a high ability to protect an organism against bacterial infection upon intraperitoneal and lung injection. In intraperitoneal infection of a mouse model with A. baumannii K9, the CPS-407 antibody protected at a dose of 25 μg/mouse. When bacteria were injected into the lung, MAb therapy prevented infection of the body and led to a significant reduction of the bacterial load in infected tissues. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> MAbs detected A. baumannii in infected lung tissue, effectively opsonized bacteria, and protected model animals from infection.	2023 Feb	Anna Karatovskaya, Natalia Rudenko, Anna Zamyatina, Anton Zvonarev, Vladimir Oleinikov, Anna Shpirt, Andrei Perepelov, Yuriy Knirel, Fedor Brovko	Microbiol Spectr
36214673	An update to the database for <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> capsular polysaccharide locus typing extends the extensive and diverse repertoire of genes found at and outside the K locus.	Several novel non-antibiotic therapeutics for the critical priority bacterial pathogen, <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>, rely on specificity to the cell-surface capsular polysaccharide (CPS). Hence, prediction of CPS type deduced from genes in whole genome sequence data underpins the development and application of these therapies. In this study, we provide a comprehensive update to the <i>A. baumannii</i> K locus reference sequence database for CPS typing (available in <i>Kaptive v. 2.0.1</i>) to include 145 new KL, providing a total of 237 KL reference sequences. The database was also reconfigured for compatibility with the updated <i>Kaptive v. 2.0.0</i> code that enables prediction of 'K type' from special logic parameters defined by detected combinations of KL and additional genes outside the K locus. Validation of the database against 8994 publicly available <i>A. baumannii</i> genome assemblies from NCBI databases identified the specific KL in 73.45 % of genomes with perfect, very high or high confidence. Poor sequence quality or the presence of insertion sequences were the main reasons for lower confidence levels. Overall, 17 KL were overrepresented in available genomes, with KL2 the most common followed by the related KL3 and KL22. Substantial variation in gene content of the central portion of the K locus, that usually includes genes specific to the CPS type, included 34 distinct groups of genes for synthesis of various complex sugars and >400 genes for forming linkages between sugars or adding non-sugar substituents. A repertoire of 681 gene types were found across the 237 KL, with 88.4 % found in <5 % of KL.	2022 Oct	Sarah M Cahill, Ruth M Hall, Johanna J Kenyon	Microb Genom

35925415	The frequency of efflux pump genes expression in Acinetobacter baumannii isolates from pulmonary secretions.	Acinetobacter baumannii is an important opportunistic pathogen, and the cause of nosocomial infections worldwide in recent decades. Efflux pumps are considered as the important causes of multidrug resistance of A. baumannii. The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of efflux pump genes, and evaluate the antibiotic effect of Tigecycline on the expression of adeB gene in isolates of multidrug-resistant. A. baumannii. 70 isolates of A. baumannii were collected and confirmed by biochemical and molecular tests. Antibiotic resistance (Ciprofloxacin, Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and Tigecycline) was performed based on the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) method. Then, the effect of Carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone inhibitor (CCCP) on isolates was investigated and the frequency of adeB, adeG, adeJ and abeM genes were examined by PCR for isolates with reduced in MIC titer. Also, the antibiotic effect of Tigecycline on adeB gene expression in A. baumannii isolates was analyzed by Real-Time PCR. The antibiotic resistance for Ciprofloxacin, Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and Tigecycline was 97.1%, 95.8% and 37.2%, respectively. Following CCCP inhibitor use, the MIC titer had a decrease in MIC titer containing CCCP inhibitor was 64.3% for Ciprofloxacin, 51.5% for Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and 50% for Tigecycline. The frequencies of genes associated with adeB, adeG, adeJ and abeM efflux pump were 100%, 92.8%, 86% and 98.5%, respectively. Real-Time PCR results showed a correlation between the antibiotic effects of Tigecycline on adeB gene expression. The antibiotic resistance of the isolates was relatively high. The isolates were resistant to Ciprofloxacin and Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole antibiotics, while more sensitive to Tigecycline. Also, efflux pump genes, which are the antibiotic resistance factors of A. baumannii, are frequently high in the isolates but it seems that isolates use other effluxe pumps than RND family to exit tigecycline.	2022 Aug	Ebrahim Rafiei, Milad Shahini Shams Abadi, Behnam Zamanzad, Abolfazl Gholipour	AMB Express

36173297	Preferential Selection of Low-Frequency, Lipopolysaccharide-Modified, Colistin-Resistant Mutants with a Combination of Antimicrobials in Acinetobacter baumannii.	Colistin, which targets lipopolysaccharide (LPS), is used as a last-resort drug against severe infections caused by drug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii. However, A. baumannii possesses two colistin-resistance mechanisms. LPS modification caused by mutations in <i>pmrAB</i> genes is often observed in clinical isolates of multidrug-resistant Gram-negative pathogens. In addition to LPS modification, A. baumannii has a unique colistin resistance mechanism, a complete loss of LPS due to mutations in the <i>lpxACD</i> genes, which are involved in LPS biosynthesis. This study aimed to elucidate the detailed mechanism of the emergence of colistin-resistant A. baumannii using strains with the same genetic background. Various colistin-resistant strains were generated experimentally using colistin alone and in combination with other antimicrobials, such as meropenem and ciprofloxacin, and the mutation spectrum was analyzed. <i>In vitro</i> selection of A. baumannii in the presence of colistin led to the emergence of strains harboring mutations in <i>lpxACD</i> genes, resulting in LPS-deficient colistin-resistant strains. However, combination of colistin with other antimicrobials led to the selection of <i>pmrAB</i> mutant strains, resulting in strains with modified LPS (LPS-modified strains). Further, the LPS-deficient strains showed decreased fitness and increased susceptibility to many antibiotics and disinfectants. As LPS-deficient strains have a higher biological cost than LPS-modified strains, our findings suggested that <i>pmrAB</i> mutants are more likely to be isolated in clinical settings. We provide novel insights into the mechanisms of resistance to colistin and provide substantial solutions along with precautions for facilitating current research and treatment of colistin-resistant A. baumannii infections. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Acinetobacter baumannii has developed resistance to various antimicrobial drugs, and its drug-resistant strains cause nosocomial infections. Controlling these infections has become a global clinical challenge. Carbapenem antibiotics are the frontline treatment drugs for infectious diseases caused by A. baumannii. For patients with infections caused by carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii, colistin-based therapy is often the only treatment option. However, A. baumannii readily acquires resistance to colistin. Many patients infected with colistin-resistant A. baumannii undergo colistin treatment before isolation of the colistin-resistant strain, and it is hypothesized that colistin resistance predominantly emerges under selective pressure during colistin therapy. Although the concomitant use of colistin and carbapenems has been reported to have a synergistic effect <i>in vitro</i> against carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii strains, our observations strongly suggest the need for attention to the emergence of strains with a modified lipopolysaccharide during treatment.	2022 Oct	Go Kamoshida, Noriteru Yamada, Tomoka Nakamura, Daiki Yamaguchi, Daichi Kai, Maho Yamashita, Chiaki Hayashi, Nana Kanda, Moe Sakaguchi, Hitoshi Morimoto, Teppei Sawada, Tomoko Okada, Yuki Kaya, Norihiko Takemoto, Kinnosuke Yahiro	Microbiol Spectr
37022167	Novel Clinical mNGS-Based Machine Learning Model for Rapid Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing of Acinetobacter baumannii.	Multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria are important public health problems. Antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST) currently uses time-consuming culture-based procedures, which cause treatment delays and increased mortality. We developed a machine learning model using Acinetobacter baumannii as an example to explore a fast AST approach using metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) data. The key genetic characteristics associated with antimicrobial resistance (AMR) were selected through a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression model based on 1,942 A. baumannii genomes. The mNGS-AST prediction model was accordingly established, validated, and optimized using read simulation sequences of clinical isolates. Clinical specimens were collected to evaluate the performance of the model retrospectively and prospectively. We identified 20, 31, 24, and 3 AMR signatures of A. baumannii for imipenem, ceftazidime, cefepime, and ciprofloxacin, respectively. Four mNGS-AST models had a positive predictive value (PPV) greater than 0.97 for 230 retrospective samples, with negative predictive values (NPVs) of 100% (imipenem), 86.67% (ceftazidime), 86.67% (cefepime), and 90.91% (ciprofloxacin). Our method classified antibacterial phenotypes with an accuracy of 97.65% for imipenem, 96.57% for ceftazidime, 97.64% for cefepime, and 98.36% for ciprofloxacin. The average reporting time of mNGS-based AST was 19.1 h, in contrast to the 63.3 h for culture-based AST, thus yielding a significant reduction of 44.3 h. mNGS-AST prediction results coincided 100% with the phenotypic AST results when testing 50 prospective samples. The mNGS-based model could be used as a rapid genotypic AST approach to identify A. baumannii and predict resistance and susceptibility to antibacterials and could be applicable to other pathogens and facilitate rational antimicrobial usage.	2023 May	Xuejiao Hu, Yunhu Zhao, Peng Han, Suling Liu, Weijiang Liu, Cong Mai, Qianyun Deng, Jing Ren, Jiajie Luo, Fangyuan Chen, Xuefeng Jia, Jing Zhang, Guanhua Rao, Bing Gu	J Clin Microbiol
36519728	An image processing-based quantification of gram variability in Acinetobacter baumannii.	Gram staining differentiates bacteria as gram-positive and gram-negative, depending on their cell wall constituents, and coloring cells in violet and pink, respectively. Sometimes, a subpopulation of the same bacterial species assumes different colors, ranging from pink to violet, for reasons that are not completely understood yet. We analyze conventional brightfield images and use an automated pipeline to count pink and violet cells. The ImageJ-based processing algorithm quantifies the gram variability in Acinetobacter baumannii ACICU in the stationary phase of growth with a percentage of 66% pink cells. Different bacterial strains and cell growth stages have been considered. RESEARCH HIGHLIGHTS: Gram staining differentiates bacteria into gram-positive (violet) and gram-negative (pink). Gram variability represents an inhomogeneous distribution of pink and violet cells within the same species.

35969073	Genomic Analysis of a Strain Collection Containing Multidrug-, Extensively Drug-, Pandrug-, and Carbapenem-Resistant Modern Clinical Isolates of Acinetobacter baumannii.	In this study, we characterize a new collection that comprises multidrug-resistant (MDR), extensively drug-resistant (XDR), pandrug-resistant (PDR), and carbapenem-resistant modern clinical isolates of Acinetobacter baumannii collected from hospitals through national microbiological surveillance in Belgium. Bacterial isolates (<i>n</i> = 43) were subjected to whole-genome sequencing (WGS), combining Illumina (MiSeq) and Nanopore (MinION) technologies, from which high-quality genomes (chromosome and plasmids) were <i>de novo</i> assembled. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed along with genome analyses, which identified intrinsic and acquired resistance determinants along with their genetic environments and vehicles. Furthermore, the bacterial isolates were compared to the most prevalent A. baumannii sequence type 2 (ST2) (Pasteur scheme) genomes available from the BIGSdb database. Of the 43 strains, 40 carried determinants of resistance to carbapenems; <i>bla</i><sub>OXA-23</sub> (<i>n</i> = 29) was the most abundant acquired antimicrobial resistance gene, with 39 isolates encoding at least two different types of OXA enzymes. According to the Pasteur scheme, the majority of the isolates were globally disseminated clones of ST2 (<i>n</i> = 25), while less frequent sequence types included ST636 (<i>n</i> = 6), ST1 (<i>n</i> = 4), ST85 and ST78 (<i>n</i> = 2 each), and ST604, ST215, ST158, and ST10 (<i>n</i> = 1 each). Using the Oxford typing scheme, we identified 22 STs, including two novel types (ST2454 and ST2455). While the majority (26/29) of <i>bla</i><sub>OXA-23</sub> genes were chromosomally carried, all <i>bla</i><sub>OXA-72</sub> genes were plasmid borne. Our results show the presence of high-risk clones of A. baumannii within Belgian health care facilities with frequent occurrences of genes encoding carbapenemases, highlighting the crucial need for constant surveillance.	2022 Sep	Adam Valcek, Kristina Nesporova, Clémence Whiteway, Tim De Pooter, Wouter De Coster, Mojca Strazisar, Charles Van der Henst	Antimicrob Agents Chemother
35862760	Acinetobacter baumannii Genomic Sequence-Based Core Genome Multilocus Sequence Typing Using Ridom SeqSphere+ and Antimicrobial Susceptibility Prediction in ARESdb.	Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) is rapidly replacing traditional typing methods for the investigation of infectious disease outbreaks. Additionally, WGS data are being used to predict phenotypic antimicrobial susceptibility. Acinetobacter baumannii, which is often multidrug-resistant, is a significant culprit in outbreaks in health care settings. A well-characterized collection of A. baumannii was studied using core genome multilocus sequence typing (cgMLST). Seventy-two isolates previously typed by PCR-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (PCR/ESI-MS) provided by the Antimicrobial Resistance Leadership Group (ARLG) were analyzed using a clinical microbiology laboratory developed workflow for cgMLST with genomic susceptibility prediction performed using the ARESdb platform. Previously performed PCR/ESI-MS correlated with cgMLST using relatedness thresholds of allelic differences of ≤9 and ≤200 allelic differences in 78 and 94% of isolates, respectively. Categorical agreement between genotypic and phenotypic antimicrobial susceptibility across a panel of 11 commonly used drugs was 89%, with minor, major, and very major error rates of 8%, 11%, and 1%, respectively.	2022 Aug	Madiha Fida, Scott A Cunningham, Stephan Beisken, Andreas E Posch, Nicholas Chia, Patricio R Jeraldo, Matthew P Murphy, Nicole M Zinsmaster, Robin Patel, Antibacterial Resistance Leadership Group	J Clin Microbiol
36081797	Apolipoprotein E mimetic peptide COG1410 combats pandrug-resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>.	The emergence of pandrug-resistant bacteria breaks through the last line of defense and raises fear among people of incurable infections. In the post-antibiotic era, the pharmaceutical field turns to seek non-conventional anti-infective agents. Antimicrobial peptides are considered a prospective solution to the crisis of antimicrobial resistance. In this study, we evaluated the antimicrobial efficiency of an ApoE mimetic peptide, COG1410, which has been confirmed to exhibit strong neural protective activity and immunomodulatory function. COG1410 showed potent antimicrobial activity against pandrug-resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>, even eliminating large inocula (10<sup>8</sup> CFU/ml) within 30 min. LC<sub>99.9</sub> in PBS and 50% pooled human plasma was 2 μg/ml (1.4 μM) and 8 μg/ml (5.6 μM), respectively. Moreover, COG1410 exhibited biofilm inhibition and eradication activity, excellent stability in human plasma, and a low propensity to induce resistance. Although COG1410 easily entered bacterial cytoplasm and bound to DNA nonspecifically, the major mechanism of COG1410 killing was to disrupt the integrity of cell membrane and lead to leakage of cytoplasmic contents, without causing obvious pores on the cell surface or cell lysis. Additionally, transcriptome analysis showed that treatment with COG1410-enriched genes involved a series of oxidation-reduction processes. DCFH-DA probe detected an increased ROS level in the presence of COG1410, indicating ROS was another hit of this AMP. Furthermore, the action of COG1410 did not depend on the electronic interaction with the LPS layer, in contrast to polymyxin B. The strong synergistic interaction between COG1410 and polymyxin B dramatically reduced the working concentration of COG1410, expanding the safety window of the application. <i>C. elegans</i> infection model showed that combined therapy of COG1410 and polymyxin B was capable of significantly rescuing the infected nematodes. Taken together, our study demonstrates that COG1410 is a promising drug candidate in the battle against pandrug-resistant <i>A. baumannii</i>.	2022	Bo Wang, Feng-Wan Zhang, Wei-Xiao Wang, Yan-Yan Zhao, Su-Yue Sun, Jin-Hong Yu, Michael P Vitek, George F Li, Rui Ma, Shiwei Wang, Zhiliang Hu, Wei Chen	Front Microbiol
36671278	Multidrug-Resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> Infections in the United Kingdom versus Egypt: Trends and Potential Natural Products Solutions.	<i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> is a problematic pathogen of global concern. It causes multiple types of infection, especially among immunocompromised individuals in intensive care units. One of the most serious concerns related to this pathogen is its ability to become resistant to almost all the available antibiotics used in clinical practice. Moreover, it has a great tendency to spread this resistance at a very high rate, crossing borders and affecting healthcare settings across multiple economic levels. In this review, we trace back the reported incidences in the PubMed and the Web of Science databases of <i>A. baumannii</i> infections in both the United Kingdom and Egypt as two representative examples for countries of two different economic levels: high and low-middle income countries. Additionally, we compare the efforts made by researchers from both countries to find solutions to the lack of available treatments by looking into natural products reservoirs. A total of 113 studies reporting infection incidence were included, with most of them being conducted in Egypt, especially the recent ones. On the one hand, this pathogen was detected in the UK many years before it was reported in Egypt; on the other hand, the contribution of Egyptian researchers to identifying a solution using natural products is more notable than that of researchers in the UK. Tracing the prevalence of <i>A. baumannii</i> infections over the years showed that the infections are on the rise, especially in Egypt vs. the UK. Further concerns are linked to the spread of antibiotic resistance among the isolates collected from Egypt reaching very alarming levels. Studies conducted in the UK showed earlier inclusion of high-throughput technologies in the tracking and detection of <i>A. baumannii</i> and its resistance than those conducted in Egypt. Possible explanations for these variations are analyzed and discussed.	2023 Jan	Wafaa H Elwakil, Soha S Rizk, Ali M El-Halawany, Mostafa E Rateb, Ahmed S Attia	Antibiotics (Basel)
36597783	Advances in research on virulence factors of Acinetobacter baumannii and their potential as novel therapeutic targets.	Acinetobacter baumannii is a strictly aerobic, nonmotile, nonfermenting, gram-negative bacillus. It is a highly infectious and invasive pathogen with high mortality and morbidity rates among immunodeficient patients. Due to increasing levels of drug resistance and the inefficiency of existing antimicrobial treatments, it is crucial to develop novel agents to control this pathogen. Several recent studies have investigated virulence factors that are associated with the pathogenesis of A. baumannii, and could thus serve as novel therapeutic targets. The present review comprehensively summarizes the current understanding of these virulence factors and their mechanisms in A. baumannii. We also highlight factors that could be potential therapeutic targets, as well as list candidate virulence factors for future researchers and clinical practitioners.	2023 Feb	Jian-Xia Zhou, Ding-Yun Feng, Xia Li, Jia-Xin Zhu, Wen-Bin Wu, Tian-Tuo Zhang	J Appl Microbiol

36190427	Clinical Outcomes of Eravacycline in Patients Treated Predominately for Carbapenem-Resistant Acinetobacter baumannii.	Forty-six patients were treated with eravacycline (ERV) for Acinetobacter baumannii infections, where 69.5% of isolates were carbapenem resistant (CRAB). Infections were primarily pulmonary (58.3%), and most patients received combination therapy (84.4%). The median (IQR) ERV duration was 6.9 days (5.1 to 11.1). Thirty-day mortality was 23.9% in the cohort and 21.9% in CRAB patients. One patient experienced an ERV-possible adverse event. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Acinetobacter baumannii, particularly when carbapenem resistant (CRAB), is one of the most challenging pathogens in the health care setting. This is complicated by the fact that there is no consensus guideline regarding management of A. baumannii infections. However, the recent Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines for treatment of resistant Gram-negative infections provided expert recommendations for CRAB management. The panel suggest using minocycline among tetracycline derivatives rather than eravacycline (ERV) until sufficient clinical data are available. Therefore, we present the largest multicenter real-world cohort in patients treated with ERV for A. baumannii, where the majority of isolates were CRAB (69.5%). Our analysis demonstrate that patients treated with ERV-based regimens achieved a 30-day mortality of 23.9% and had a low incidence of ERV-possible adverse events (2.1%). This study is important as it fills the gap in the literature regarding the use of a novel tetracycline (i.e., ERV) in the treatment of this challenging health care infection.	2022 Oct	Sara Alosaimy, Taylor Morrisette, Abdalhamid M Lagnf, Leonor M Rojas, Madeline A King, Benjamin M Pullinger, Athena L V Hobbs, Nicholson B Perkins, Michael P Veve, Jeannette Bouchard, Tristan Gore, Bruce Jones, James Truong, Justin Andrade, Glen Huang, Reese Cosimi, S Lena Kang-Birken, Kyle C Molina, Mark Biagi, Michael Pierce, Marco R Scipione, Jing J Zhao, Susan L Davis, Michael J Rybak	Microbiol Spectr
36512492	Repurposed dihydroorotate dehydrogenase inhibitors with efficacy against drug-resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>.	New antimicrobials are needed for the treatment of extensively drug-resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>. The de novo pyrimidine biosynthetic enzyme dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) is a validated drug target for malaria and human autoimmune diseases. We provide genetic evidence that <i>A. baumannii</i> DHODH (<i>Ab</i>DHODH) is essential for bacterial survival in rodent infection models. We chemically validate the target by repurposing a unique library of ~450 triazolopyrimidine/imidazopyrimidine analogs developed for our malaria DHODH program to identify 21 compounds with submicromolar activity on <i>Ab</i>DHODH. The most potent (DSM186, DHODH IC<sub>50</sub> 28 nM) had a minimal inhibitory concentration of ≤1 µg/ml against geographically diverse <i>A. baumannii</i> strains, including meropenem-resistant isolates. A structurally related analog (DSM161) with a long in vivo half-life conferred significant protection in the neutropenic mouse thigh infection model. Encouragingly, the development of resistance to these compounds was not identified in vitro or in vivo. Lastly, the X-ray structure of <i>Ab</i>DHODH bound to DSM186 was solved to 1.4 Å resolution. These data support the potential of <i>Ab</i>DHODH as a drug target for the development of antimicrobials for the treatment of <i>A. baumannii</i> and potentially other high-risk bacterial infections.	2022 Dec	Thomas A Russo, Timothy C Umland, Xiaoyi Deng, Farah El Mazouni, Sreekanth Kokkonda, Ruth Olson, Ulrike Carlino-MacDonald, Janet Beanan, Cassandra L Alvarado, Diana R Tomchick, Alan Hutson, Hong Chen, Bruce Posner, Pradipsinh K Rathod, Susan A Charman, Margaret A Phillips	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A

36537173	Anti-adhesion and antibiofilm activities of <i>Lavandula mairei</i> humbert essential oil against <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> isolated from hospital intensive care units.	This study aimed to assess, for the first time, the anti-adhesion and antibiofilm effects of <i>Lavandula mairei</i> Humbert essential oil against multidrug resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>. Scanning electron microscope was used for visualizing its antibiofilm activity and the effect of this oil on surface physicochemical parameters was examined as a possible anti-adhesive target. Chemical analysis of <i>Lavandulaa mairei</i> essential oil showed a high content of carvacrol composition (79.12%). The oil tested exhibited antibacterial efficacy with inhibition diameters of 33 to 37.33 mm and minimum inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations of 1.56 µl ml<sup>-1</sup>. The oil inhibited adhesion by 83.66%, detach 73.30% of adherent cells and eliminated 64.02% of the biofilm compared to the untreated control. <i>Lavandula mairei</i> essential oil has proven its possible application as a preventive strategy by intervening in the initial adhesion of <i>Acinetobacter baumannii to polystyrene.</i>	2022 Nov	Raja El Kheloui, Asma Laktib, Soufiane Elmegdar, Lahbib Fayzi, Chorouk Zanane, Fouad Msanda, Khalil Cherifi, Hassan Latrache, Rachida Mimouni, Fatima Hamadi	Biofouling
36752373	Comparison of the structure and activity of thioredoxin 2 and thioredoxin 1 from Acinetobacter baumannii.	Thioredoxin (Trx) is essential in a redox-control system, with many bacteria containing two Trxs: Trx1 and Trx2. Due to a Trx system's critical function, Trxs are targets for novel antibiotics. Here, a 1.20 Å high-resolution structure of Trx2 from Acinetobacter baumannii (abTrx2), an antibiotic resistant pathogenic superbug, is elucidated. By comparing Trx1 and Trx2, it is revealed that the two Trxs possess similar activity, although Trx2 contains an additional N-terminal zinc-finger domain and exhibits more flexible properties in solution. Finally, it is shown that the Trx2 zinc-finger domain might be rotatable and that proper zinc coordination at the zinc-finger domain is critical to abTrx2 activity. This study enhances understanding of the Trx system and will facilitate the design of novel antibiotics.	2023 Mar	Ye Ji Chang, Ji Hye Sung, Chang Sup Lee, Jun Hyuck Lee, Hyun Ho Park	IUCrJ

Currently, 50%-70% of clinical isolates of <i>A. baumannii</i> are extensively drug-resistant, and available antibiotic options against <i>A. baumannii</i> infections are limited. There is still a need to discover specific <i>de facto</i> bacterial antigenic proteins that could be effective vaccine candidates in human infection.

35987095	Structural insight into substrate binding of Acinetobacter baumannii polyphosphate-AMP phosphotransferase (PPK2), a novel drug target.	Acinetobacter baumannii is an opportunistic pathogen known for high morbidity and mortality. It causes life-threatening infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), bacteremia, meningitis, wound and urinary tract infections (UTI). Increase in carbapenem resistance exhibited by A. baumannii has accentuated the need for novel targets for effective treatment. Despite the pronounced relevance of PPK2 as a pathogenicity determinant in several pathogens, it has not been explored as a drug target in A. baumannii. The present study was piloted to investigate the substrate binding by A. baumannii PPK2 (AbPPK2), a two-domain Class II polyphosphate kinase 2. A homology model of AbPPK2 was developed and validated for molecular docking of ATP and ADP in the predicted binding pocket. Further analysis of AbPPK2 revealed a set of common residues in the catalytic cleft interacting with ATP and ADP which would be useful for the screening of inhibitors against A. baumannii.	2022 Oct	Lalit Kumar Gautam, Prince Sharma, Neena Capalash	Biochem Biophys Res Commun
36421279	Contribution of RND-Type Efflux Pumps in Reduced Susceptibility to Biocides in <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>.	Bacterial efflux pumps are among the key mechanisms of resistance against antibiotics and biocides. We investigated whether differential expression levels of the RND-type efflux pumps AdeABC and AdeIJK impacted the susceptibility to commonly used biocides in multidrug-resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>. Susceptibility testing and time-kill assays of defined laboratory and clinical <i>A. baumannii</i> strains with different levels of efflux pump expression were performed after exposure to the biocides benzalkonium chloride, chlorhexidine digluconate, ethanol, glucoprotamin, octenidine dihydrochloride, and triclosan. While the impact of efflux pump expression on susceptibility to the biocides was limited, noticeable differences were found in kill curves, where AdeABC expression correlated with greater survival after exposure to benzalkonium chloride, chlorhexidine digluconate, glucoprotamin, and octenidine dihydrochloride. AdeABC expression levels did not impact kill kinetics with ethanol nor triclosan. In conclusion, these data indicate that the overexpression of the RND-type efflux pumps AdeABC and AdeIJK contributes to the survival of <i>A. baumannii</i> when exposed to residual concentrations of biocides.	2022 Nov	Christina Meyer, Kai Lucaβen, Stefanie Gerson, Kyriaki Xanthopoulou, Thorsten Wille, Harald Seifert, Paul G Higgins	Antibiotics (Basel)

35958553	CipA mediates complement resistance of <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> by formation of a factor I-dependent quadripartite assemblage.	Multidrug-resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> is known to be one of the leading pathogens that cause severe nosocomial infections. To overcome eradication by the innate immune system during infection, <i>A. baumannii</i> developed a number of immune evasion strategies. Previously, we identified CipA as a plasminogen-binding and complement-inhibitory protein. Here we show that CipA inhibits all three complement activation pathways and interacts with key complement components C3, C3b, C4b, C5, Factor B, Factor D, and in particular Factor I. CipA also targets function of the C5 convertase as cleavage of C5 was impaired. Systematic screening of CipA variants identified two separate binding sites for C3b and a Factor I-interacting domain located at the C-terminus. Structure predictions using AlphaFold2 and binding analyses employing CipA variants lacking Factor I-binding capability confirmed that the orientation of the C-terminal domain is essential for the interaction with Factor I. Hence, our analyses point to a novel Factor I-dependent mechanisms of complement inactivation mediated by CipA of <i>A. baumannii</i>. Recruitment of Factor I by CipA initiates the assembly of a quadripartite complex following binding of either Factor H or C4b-binding protein to degrade C3b and C4b, respectively. Loss of Factor I binding in a CipA-deficient strain, or a strain producing a CipA variant lacking Factor I-binding capability, correlated with a higher susceptibility to human serum, indicating that recruitment of Factor I enables <i>A. baumannii</i> to resist complement-mediated killing.	2022	Julia I Ries, Marie Heß, Noura Nouri, Thomas A Wichelhaus, Stephan Göttig, Franco H Falcone, Peter Kraiczy	Front Immunol
37022613	Designing of multi-epitope peptide vaccine against Acinetobacter baumannii through combined immunoinformatics and protein interaction-based approaches.	Acinetobacter baumannii is one of the major pathogenic ESKAPE bacterium, which is responsible for about more than 722,000 cases in a year, globally. Despite the alarming increase in multidrug resistance, a safe and effective vaccine for Acinetobacter infections is still not available. Hence in the current study, a multiepitope vaccine construct was developed using linear B cell, cytotoxic T cell, and helper T cell epitopes from the antigenic and well-conserved lipopolysaccharide assembly proteins employing systematic immunoinformatics and structural vaccinology strategies. The multi-peptide vaccine was predicted to be highly antigenic, non-allergenic, non-toxic, and cover maximum population coverage worldwide. Further, the vaccine construct was modeled along with adjuvant and peptide linkers and validated to achieve a high-quality three-dimensional structure which was subsequently utilized for cytokine prediction, disulfide engineering, and docking analyses with Toll-like receptor (TLR4). Ramachandran plot showed 98.3% of the residues were located in the most favorable and permitted regions, thereby corroborating the feasibility of the modeled vaccine construct. Molecular dynamics simulation for a 100 ns timeframe further confirmed the stability of the binding vaccine-receptor complex. Finally, in silico cloning and codon adaptation were also performed with the pET28a (+) plasmid vector to determine the efficiency of expression and translation of the vaccine. Immune simulation studies demonstrated that the vaccine could trigger both B and T cell responses and can elicit strong primary, secondary, and tertiary immune responses. The designed multi-peptide subunit vaccine would certainly expedite the experimental approach for the development of a vaccine against A. baumannii infection.	2023 Apr	Jyotirmayee Dey, Soumya Ranjan Mahapatra, Pawan K Singh, Samudyata C Prabhuswamimath, Namrata Misra, Mrutyunjay Suar	Immunol Res
35278346	Pharmacophore screening, denovo designing, retrosynthetic analysis, and combinatorial synthesis of a novel lead VTRA1.1 against RecA protein of Acinetobacter baumannii.	Antibiotics and disinfectants resistance is acquired by activating RecA-mediated DNA repair, which maintains ROS-dependent DNA damage caused by the antimicrobial molecules. To increase the efficacy of different antimicrobials, an inhibitor can be developed against RecA protein. The present study aims to design a denovo inhibitor against RecA protein of Acinetobacter baumannii. Pharmacophore-based screening, molecular mechanics, molecular dynamics simulation (MDS), retrosynthetic analysis, and combinatorial synthesis were used to design lead VTRA1.1 against RecA of A. baumannii. Pharmacophore models (structure-based and ligand-based) were created, and a phase library of FDA-approved drugs was prepared. Screening of the phase library against these pharmacophore models selected thirteen lead molecules. These filtered leads were used for the denovo fragment-based design, which produced 253 combinations. These designed molecules were further analyzed for its interaction with active site of RecA that selected a hybrid VTRA1. Further, retrosynthetic analysis and combinatorial synthesis produced 1000 analogs of VTRA1 by more than 100 modifications. These analogs were used for XP docking, binding free energy calculation, and MDS analysis which finally select lead VTRA1.1 against RecA protein. Further, mutations at the interacting residues of RecA with VTRA1.1, alter the unfolding rate of RecA, which suggests the binding of VTRA1.1 to these residues may alter the stability of RecA. It is also found that VTRA1.1 had reduced interaction of RecA with LexA and ssDNA polydT, showing the lead's efficacy in controlling the SOS response. Further, it was also observed that VTRA1.1 does not contain any predicted human off-targets and no cytotoxicity to cell lines. As functional RecA is involved in antimicrobial resistance, denovo designed lead VTRA1.1 against RecA may be further developed as a significant combination for therapeutic uses against A. baumannii.	2022 Jun	Vishvanath Tiwari	Chem Biol Drug Des
35872312	Structure of the K98 capsular polysaccharide from Acinetobacter baumannii REV-1184 containing a cyclic pyruvic acid acetal.	The K98 capsular polysaccharide (CPS) from the Acinetobacter baumannii clinical isolate, REV-1184, was studied by sugar analysis and Smith degradation along with one- and two-dimensional <sup>1</sup>H and <sup>13</sup>C NMR spectroscopy and high-resolution electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. The CPS was found to consist of linear tetrasaccharide repeats (K-units) that include one residue each of d-GlcpNAc, d-GalpNAc, 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-d-galacturonic acid (d-GalpNAcA), and 2-acetamido-2,6-dideoxy-d-glucose (N-acetylquinovosamine, d-QuipNAc), with the GalpNAc residue decorated with a (R)-configurated 4,6-pyruvic acid acetal group. The CPS has a similar composition to that of A. baumannii K4 but the topology of the tetrasaccharide K-unit is different (linear in K98 versus branched in K4). This was due to a difference in sequence for the Wzy polymerases encoded by the CPS biosynthesis gene clusters KL98 and KL4, with the Wzy<sub>K98</sub> polymerase forming a β-d-QuipNAc-(1→3)-d-GalpNAc linkage between the K98 units.	2022 Oct	Anastasiya A Kasimova, Mikhail M Shneider, Mikhail V Edelstein, Alina A Dzhaparova, Alexander S Shashkov, Yuriy A Knirel, Johanna J Kenyon	Int J Biol Macromol

35587639	High Prevalence of ST502 Carrying an OXA-24 Carbapenemase gene in Carbapenem-Nonsusceptible <i>Acinetobacter baumannii-calcoaceticus</i> Isolates in Romania.	<b><i>Background:</i></b> <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> can cause difficult-to-treat infections because it can acquire extensive antimicrobial resistance mechanisms. We aim to describe the antimicrobial resistance pattern and the genetic basis of carbapenem-nonsusceptible <i>A. baumannii</i> isolates in a University Hospital in Romania, a country where multidrug-resistant <i>A. baumannii</i> is widespread. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> We collected 104 consecutive meropenem-nonsusceptible <i>A. baumannii</i> isolates from 104 patients (36% female, mean age [SD] of 63 [16] years) between May 2015 and August 2017 from a large tertiary center in Romania. Whole-genome sequencing of representative isolates from amplified fragment length polymorphism clusters was used to determine clonality and resistance patterns. <b><i>Results:</i></b> All isolates were resistant to piperacillin/tazobactam, ceftazidime, and ciprofloxacin; 88.5% to gentamicin; and 90.4% to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. In contrast, 79.8% and 99.0% were susceptible to tobramycin and colistin, respectively. The only isolate resistant to colistin had an minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of ≥16 mg/L. The <i>bla<sub>OXA-24</sub></i> gene was detected in 79.1% and <i>bla<sub>OXA-23</sub></i> in 20.9% of the isolates. In one isolate, <i>bla<sub>OXA-23</sub></i> was copresent with <i>bla<sub>OXA-24</sub></i>. ST502 (Oxford scheme) was the most prevalent sequence type and was exclusively associated with <i>bla<sub>OXA-24</sub></i>. <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> ST502 associated with <i>bla<sub>OXA-24</sub></i> was frequently observed in the region where carbapenem-nonsusceptible <i>A. baumannii</i> was found to be endemic. In these isolates, tobramycin and colistin might be the remaining therapeutic options. Due to differences in gentamicin and tobramycin resistance in these isolates, surveillance data should not group gentamicin, tobramycin, and amikacin together as aminoglycosides.	2022 Jun	Erlangga Yusuf, Manuela Tompa, Nikolaos Strepis, Corné H W Klaassen, Wil H F Goessens	Microb Drug Resist
36070164	Myconanoparticles Break Antibiotic Resistance in Staphylococcus aureus and Acinetobacter baumannii.	In this current study, the extracts of endophytic fungi (Aspergillus niger) were utilized to synthesize the silver nanoparticles (AnNps). In silico screening was carried out by docking secondary metabolites of Aspergillus niger with drug-resistant proteins such as penicillin-binding protein (pbp2a) and clumping factor A of Staphylococcus aureus, penicillin-binding protein (PBP3), and outer membrane protein of Acinetobacter baumannii. The molecular docking analysis revealed the interaction between secondary metabolites of Aspergillus niger with virulence factors of the pathogenic bacteria. AnNps are characterized by various physicochemical methods to determine the size, shape, and stability. Antibacterial efficacy of synthesized nanoparticles (AnNps) was screened in clinical pathogens. AnNp treatment significantly reduced the growth of MDR pathogens. The results suggested that AnNps can be incorporated to produce antimicrobial agents to control drug resistant pathogenic bacteria.	2023 Jan	S Janarthanan, S Ranjani, S Hemalatha	Appl Biochem Biotechnol
36238282	Whole-cell vaccine candidates induce a protective response against virulent <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>.	<i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> causes multi-system diseases in both nosocomial settings and a pre-disposed general population. The bacterium is not only desiccation-resistant but also notoriously resistant to multiple antibiotics and drugs of last resort including carbapenem, colistin, and sulbactam. The World Health Organization has categorized carbapenem-resistant <i>A. baumannii</i> at the top of its critical pathogen list in a bid to direct urgent countermeasure development. Several early-stage vaccines have shown a range of efficacies in healthy mice, but no vaccine candidates have advanced into clinical trials. Herein, we report our findings that both an ionizing γ-radiation-inactivated and a non-ionizing ultraviolet C-inactivated whole-cell vaccine candidate protects neutropenic mice from pulmonary challenge with virulent AB5075, a particularly pathogenic isolate. In addition, we demonstrate that a humoral response is sufficient for this protection <i>via</i> the passive immunization of neutropenic mice.	2022	Stephen J Dollery, Daniel V Zurawski, Ruth V Bushnell, John K Tobin, Taralyn J Wiggins, David A MacLeod, Naomi J P E R Tasker, Yonas A Alamneh, Rania Abu-Taleb, Christine M Czintos, Wanwen Su, Mariel G Escatte, Heather N Meeks, Michael J Daly, Gregory J Tobin	Front Immunol
37184390	Alteration of <i>adeS</i> Contributes to Tigecycline Resistance and Collateral Sensitivity to Sulbactam in Acinetobacter baumannii.	The treatment of extensively drug-resistant (XDR) A. baumannii has emerged as a major problem. Tigecycline (TGC) and sulbactam (SUL) are both effective antibiotics against XDR A. baumannii. Here, we investigated the in-host evolution and mechanism of collateral sensitivity (CS) phenomenon in development of tigecycline resistance accompanied by a concomitant increase of sulbactam susceptibility. A total of four XDR A. baumannii strains were sequentially isolated from the same patient suffering from bacteremia. Core-genome multilocus sequence typing separated all the strains into two clusters. Comparative analysis of isolate pair 1 revealed that multiplication of <i>bla</i><sub>OXA-23</sub> within Tn<i>2006</i> on the chromosome contributed to the change in the antimicrobial susceptibility phenotype of isolate pair 1. Additionally, we observed the emergence of CS to sulbactam in isolate pair 2, as demonstrated by an 8-fold increase in the TGC MIC with a simultaneous 4-fold decrease in the SUL MIC. Compared to the parental strain Ab-3557, YZM-0406 showed partial deletion in the two-component system sensor <i>adeS</i>. Reconstruction of the <i>adeS</i> mutant in Ab-3557 <i>in situ</i> suggested that TGC resistance and CS to SUL were mainly caused by the mutation of <i>adeS</i>. Overall, our study reported a novel CS combination of TGC and SUL in A. baumannii and further revealed a mechanism of CS attributed to the mutation of <i>adeS</i>. This study provides a valuable foundation for developing effective regimens and sequential combinations of tigecycline and sulbactam against XDR A. baumannii. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Collateral sensitivity (CS) has become an increasingly common evolutionary trade-off during adaptive bacterial evolution. Here, we report a novel combination of tigecycline (TGC) resistance and CS to sulbactam (SUL) in A. baumannii. TGC and SUL are both effective antibiotics against XDR A. baumannii, and it is essential to reveal the mechanism of CS between TGC and SUL. In our study, the partial deletion of <i>adeS</i>, a two-component system sensor, was confirmed to be the key factor contributing to this CS phenomenon. This study provides a valuable foundation for developing effective regimens and sequential combinations of tigecycline and sulbactam against XDR A. baumannii.	2023 May	Yunxing Yang, Xiaochen Liu, Danyan Zhou, Jintao He, Qiong Chen, Qingye Xu, Shenghai Wu, Weiying Zhang, Yue Yao, Ying Fu, Xiaoting Hua, Yunsong Yu, Xianjun Wang	Microbiol Spectr
37052493	Infection of Endothelial Cells with Acinetobacter baumannii Reveals Remodelling of Mitochondrial Protein Complexes.	Acinetobacter baumannii is an antibiotic-resistant, Gram-negative pathogen that causes a multitude of nosocomial infections. However, pathogenicity mechanisms and the host cell response during infection remain unclear. In this study, we determined virulence traits of A. baumannii clinical isolates belonging to the most widely disseminated international clonal lineage, international cluster 2 (IC2), <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. Complexome profiling of primary human endothelial cells with A. baumannii revealed that mitochondria, and in particular complexes of the electron transport chain, are important host cell targets. Infection with highly virulent A. baumannii remodelled assembly of mitochondrial protein complexes and led to metabolic adaptation. These were characterized by reduced mitochondrial respiration and glycolysis in contrast to those observed in infection with low-pathogenicity A. baumannii. Perturbation of oxidative phosphorylation, destabilization of mitochondrial ribosomes, and interference with mitochondrial metabolic pathways were identified as important pathogenicity mechanisms. Understanding the interaction of human host cells with the current global A. baumannii clone is the basis to identify novel therapeutic targets. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Virulence traits of Acinetobacter baumannii isolates of the worldwide most prevalent international clonal lineage, IC2, remain largely unknown. In our study, multidrug-resistant IC2 clinical isolates differed substantially in their virulence potential despite their close genetic relatedness. Our data suggest that, at least for some isolates, mitochondria are important target organelles during infection of primary human endothelial cells. Complexes of the respiratory chain were extensively remodelled after infection with a highly virulent A. baumannii strain, leading to metabolic adaptation characterized by severely reduced respiration and glycolysis. Perturbations of both mitochondrial morphology and mitoribosomes were identified as important pathogenicity mechanisms. Our data might help to further decipher the molecular mechanisms of A. baumannii and host mitochondrial interaction during infection.	2023 Apr	Laura Leukert, Manuela Tietgen, Felix F Krause, Tilman G Schultze, Dominik C Fuhrmann, Charline Debruyne, Suzana P Salcedo, Alexander Visekruna, Llka Wittig, Stephan Göttig	Microbiol Spectr
36416541	Overexpression of a DNA Methyltransferase Increases Persister Cell Formation in Acinetobacter baumannii.	Many mechanisms have been proposed to be involved in the formation of bacterial persister cells. In this study, we investigated the impact of <i>dam</i> encoding DNA methylation on persister cell formation in Acinetobacter. We constructed plasmids overexpressing <i>dam</i> encoding DNA-(adenine N6)-methyltransferase and four genes as possibly involved in persistence and introduced them into three A. baumannii strains. For persister cell formation assays, bacteria were exposed to ciprofloxacin, imipenem, cefotaxime, and rifampin, and the transcription levels of the genes were measured by qRT-PCR. In addition, growth curves of strains were determined. We found that all five genes were upregulated following antibiotic exposure. Dam overexpression increased persister cell formation rates and activated the four persister cell-involved genes. Among the four persister cell-involved genes, only RecC overexpression increase persister cell formation rates. While <i>recC</i>-overexpressing strains showed higher growth rates, <i>dam</i>-overexpressing strains showed decreased growth rates. In this study, we revealed that a DNA methyltransferase may regulate persister cell formation in A. baumannii, while RecC seems to mediate epigenetic regulation of persister cell formation. However, Dam and RecC may act at different persister cell formation states. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Bacterial persister cells are not killed by high concentration of antibiotics, despite its antibiotic susceptibility. It has been known that they may cause antibiotic treatment failure and contribute to the evolution of antibiotic resistance. Although many mechanisms have been suggested and verified for persister cell formation, many remains to be uncovered. In this study, we report that DNA methyltransferase leads to an increase in persister cell formation, through transcriptional activation of several regulatory genes. Our results suggest that DNA methyltransferases could be target proteins to prevent formation of persister cells.	2022 Dec	Hyunkeun Kim, Jee Hong Kim, Hongbaek Cho, Kwan Soo Ko	Microbiol Spectr

36739749	Aromatic hydrazides: A potential solution for Acinetobacter baumannii infections.	The emergence of multidrug-resistant bacteria and the poor efficacy of available antibiotics against these infections have led to the urgent need for novel antibiotics. Acinetobacter baumannii is one of high-priority pathogens due to its ability to mount resistance to different classes of antibiotics. In an effort to provide novel agents in the fight against infections caused by A. baumannii, we synthesized a series of 46 aromatic hydrazides as potential treatments. In this series, 34 compounds were found to be low- to sub-μM inhibitors of A. baumannii growth, with MIC values in the range of 8 μg/mL to ≤0.125 μg/mL against a broad set of multidrug-resistant clinical isolates. These compounds were not highly active against other bacteria. We showed that one of the most potent compounds, 3e, was bacteriostatic and inhibitory to biofilm formation, although it did not disrupt the preformed biofilm. Additionally, we found that these compounds lacked mammalian cytotoxicity. The high antibacterial potency and the lack of mammalian cytotoxicity make these compounds a promising lead series for development of a novel selective anti-A. baumannii antibiotic.	2023 Mar	Keith D Green, Nishad Thamban Chandrika, Loan Y Vu, Allan H Pang, Oleg V Tsodikov, Sylvie Garneau-Tsodikova	Eur J Med Chem
36905472	Novel adjuvant nano-vaccine induced immune response against Acinetobacter baumannii.	Developing adjuvant vaccines to combat rising multidrug-resistant (MDR) Acinetobacter baumannii (A. baumannii) infections is a promising and cost-effective approach. The aim of this analysis was to construct a pDNA-CPG C274-adjuvant nano-vaccine and investigate its immunogenicity and protection in BALB/c mice. The CPG ODN C274 adjuvant was chemically synthesized and cloned into pcDNA3.1( +), and the cloning was verified using PCR and BamHI/EcoRV restriction enzyme digestion. Then, utilizing a complex coacervation approach, pDNA-CPG C274 was encapsulated by chitosan (CS) nanoparticles (NPs). TEM and DLS are used to explore the properties of the pDNA/CSNP complex. TLR-9 pathway activation was investigated in human HEK-293 and RAW 264.7 mouse cells. The vaccine's immunogenicity and immune-protective effectiveness were investigated in BALB/c mice. The pDNA-CPG C274/CSNPs were small (mean size 79.21 ± 0.23 nm), positively charged (+ 38.87 mV), and appeared to be spherical. A continuous slow release pattern was achieved. TLR-9 activation was greatest in the mouse model with CpG ODN (C274) at concentrations of 5 and 10 μg/ml with 56% and 55%, respectively (**P < 0.01). However, in HEK-293 human cells, by increasing the concentration of CpG ODN (C274) from 1 to 50 μg/ml, the activation rate of TLR-9 also increased, so that the highest activation rate (81%) was obtained at the concentration of 50 μg/ml (***P < 0.001). pDNA-CPG C274/CSNPs immunized BALB/c mice produced increased amounts of total-IgG, as well as IFN-γ and IL-1B in serum samples, compared to non-encapsulated pDNA-CPG C274. Furthermore, liver and lung injuries, as well as bacterial loads in the liver, lung, and blood, were reduced, and BALB/c mice immunized with pDNA-CPG C274/CSNPs showed potent protection (50-75%) against acute fatal Intraperitoneal A. baumannii challenge. pDNA-CPG C274/CSNPs evoked total-IgG antibodies, Th1 cellular immunity, and the TLR-9 pathway, as well as protection against an acute fatal A. baumannii challenge. Our findings suggest that this nano-vaccine is a promising approach for avoiding A. baumannii infection when used as a powerful adjuvant.	2023 Mar	Tohid Piri-Gharaghie, Abbas Doosti, Seyed Abbas Mirzaei	AMB Express
35283314	Polymyxin dose tunes the evolutionary dynamics of resistance in multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii.	Evolutionary principles have informed the design of strategies that slow or prevent antibiotic resistance. However, how antibiotic treatment regimens shape the evolutionary dynamics of resistance mutations remains an open question. Here, we investigate varying concentrations of the last-resort polymyxins on the evolution of resistance in Acinetobacter baumannii.	2022 Jul	Jinxin Zhao, Yan Zhu, Yu-Wei Lin, Heidi Yu, Hasini Wickremasinghe, Jiru Han, Tony Velkov, Michael J McDonald, Jian Li	Clin Microbiol Infect
36201141	In vitro and in vivo efficacy of cefiderocol plus tigecycline, colistin, or meropenem against carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii.	We investigated activities of cefiderocol combination therapy against carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CR-AB). A total of 123 clinical isolates of CR-AB, including 44 cefiderocol-resistant isolates were tested. Cefiderocol functioned synergistically with tigecycline in most cefiderocol-susceptible isolates (84.8%, 67/79), but not with colistin or meropenem by checkerboard method. Cefiderocol functioned synergistically with tigecycline, colistin, and meropenem in 90.9% (40/44), 47.7% (21/44), and 79.5% (35/44) cefiderocol-resistant isolates, respectively. The time-kill assay and the in vivo Galleria mellonella model confirmed these observations. In summary, cefiderocol combined with tigecycline showed synergistic effects against both cefiderocol-susceptible and -resistant CR-AB, suggesting a potentially valuable combination regimen.	2022 Dec	Wentao Ni, Yifan Wang, Xinqian Ma, Yukun He, Jin Zhao, Jie Guan, Yanjun Li, Zhancheng Gao	Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis
36395844	High diversity of the emerging pathogen Acinetobacter baumannii and other Acinetobacter spp. in raw manure, biogas plants digestates, and rural and urban wastewater treatment plants with system specific antimicrobial resistance profiles.	Carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii causing immense treatment problems in hospitals. There is still a knowledge gap on the abundance and stability of acquired resistances and the diversity of resistant Acinetobacter in the environment. The aim of the study was to investigate the diversity and antimicrobial resistances of Acinetobacter spp. released from livestock and human wastewater into the environment. Raw and digested manure of small scale on farm biogas plants as well as untreated and treated wastewater and sewage sludge of rural and urban wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) were studied comparatively. A total of 132 Acinetobacter isolates were phylogenetically identified (16S rRNA gene and rpoB sequence analyses) and 14 different phylotypes were detected. Fiftytwo isolates represented A. baumannii which were cultured from raw and digested manure of different biogas plants, and most stages of the rural WWTP (no hospital wastewater receiving) and the two studied urban WWTPs receiving veterinarian and human hospital wastewater. Multi-locus sequence typing (Pasteur_MLST) identified 23 novel and 12 known STs of A. baumannii. Most novel STs (18/23) were cultured from livestock samples and the rural WWTP. A. baumannii isolates from livestock and the rural WWTP were susceptible to carbapenems, colistin, ciprofloxacin, ceftazidime, and piperacillin. In contrast, A. baumannii isolates from the two urban WWTPs showed clinical linkage with respect to MLST and were multi-drug resistant (MDR). The presence of viable A. baumannii in digested manure and sewage sludge confirmed the survival of the strict aerobic bacteria during anoxic conditions. The study indicated the spread of diverse Acinetobacter from anthropogenic sources into the environment with a strong linkage of clinial associated MDR A. baumannii strains to the inflow of hospital wastewater to WWTPs. A more frequent detection of Acinetobacter in sewage sludge than effluent waters indicated that particle-attachment of Acinetobacter must be considered by the risk assessment of these bacteria.	2023 Feb	Dipen Pulami, Peter Kämpfer, Stefanie P Glaeser	Sci Total Environ

36401642	A novel pentavalent vaccine candidate completely protects against Acinetobacter baumannii in a mouse model of peritonitis.	Acinetobacter baumannii is considered as one of the most virulent and infectious organisms that have an increased ability to both evade host immune response and resist various classes of antibiotics, leading to life-threatening infections. Multiple virulence factors have been implicated in the high prevalence rate of A. baumannii in hospitalized and immunocompromised patients. Moreover, improper use of antibiotics has led to the emergence of extensive drug-resistant strains that urgently require alternative strategies to control this superbug. Unfortunately, the availability of a licensed vaccine against A. baumannii infections is still challenged by the vast diversity among A. baumannii strains. Here, we report the development of a novel pentavalent vaccine candidate composed of two recombinant proteins (Wza and YiaD) and a pool of capsular polysaccharides isolated from 3 clinical isolates. We tested this new vaccine in vivo in a mouse model of peritonitis against the standard strain ATCC 19606 in addition to 3 clinical isolates of A. baumannii. Immunization with this vaccine completely protected the challenged mice with 100% survival rate in the case of all the tested bacteria. Further clinical studies are urgently needed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of this proprietary vaccine to protect patients from A. baumannii lethal infections. KEY POINTS: • Recombinant proteins pool (Wza and YiaD) immunization led to a synergistic immune response. • Capsular polysaccharides pool induced up to 90% protection of tested clinical isolates. • The pentavalent pool showed superiority with 100% survival of immunized mice.	2022 Dec	Yomna A Hagag, Heba Shehta Said, Hany I Kenawy, Ramadan Hassan	Appl Microbiol Biotechnol

35872309	The K218 capsular polysaccharide produced by Acinetobacter baumannii isolate 52-249 includes 5,7-di-N-acetylpseudaminic acid linked by a KpsS3 glycosyltransferase.	Two acylated forms of the higher sugar, 5,7-diamino-3,5,7,9-tetradeoxy-l-glycero-l-manno-non-2-ulosonic acid called pseudaminic acid, Pse5Ac7Ac and Pse5Ac7RHb where R indicates (R)-3-hydroxybutanoyl, have been found to occur in many capsular polysaccharide (CPS) types produced by isolates of an important human pathogen, Acinetobacter baumannii. The presence of either a psaABCEDF or psaABCGHF gene module at the K locus (KL) for CPS biosynthesis determines the type of the variant produced. Here, an A. baumannii clinical isolate 52-249, recovered in 2015 in Moscow, Russia, was found to include a novel psaABCIJF gene module in the KL218 sequence at the K locus. The CPS from 52-249 was extracted and studied by sugar analysis and partial acid hydrolysis along with one- and two-dimensional <sup>1</sup>H and <sup>13</sup>C NMR spectroscopy. A branched tetrasaccharide repeating unit was identified, which included a →3)-α-d-Galp-(1→6)-α-d-GlcpNAc-(1→3)-β-d-GalpNAc-(1→ main chain and Pse5Ac7Ac attached as a side branch, indicating that the psaABCIJF gene module is associated with synthesis of this variant. The K218 CPS was found to be structurally related to the K46 CPS of A. baumannii, and a comparison of the two structures enabled the assignment of glycosyltransferases. A KpsS3 protein for the α-(2→6) linkage of the Pse5Ac7Ac residue to D-Galp in K218 was identified.	2022 Oct	Anastasiya A Kasimova, Aleksandra G Dudnik, Alexander S Shashkov, Mikhail M Shneider, Alex Christofferson, Andrey A Shelenkov, Yuliya V Mikhailova, Johanna J Kenyon, Yuriy A Knirel	Int J Biol Macromol
36648597	The Tol-Pal system of Acinetobacter baumannii is important for cell morphology, antibiotic resistance and virulence.	Acinetobacter baumannii is an opportunistic human pathogen that has become a global threat to healthcare institutions. This Gram-negative bacterium is one of the most successful human pathogens worldwide and responsible for hospital-acquired infections. This is due to its outstanding potential to adapt to very different environments, to persist in the human host and most important, its ability to develop multidrug resistance. Our combined approach of genomic and phenotypic analyses led to the identification of the envelope spanning Tol-Pal system in A. baumannii. We found that the deletion of the tolQ, tolR, tolA, tolB, and pal genes affects cell morphology and increases antibiotic sensitivity, such as the ∆tol-pal mutant exhibits a significantly increased gentamicin and bacitracin sensitivity. Furthermore, Galleria mellonella caterpillar killing assays revealed that the ∆tol-pal mutant exhibits a decreased killing phenotype. Taken together, our findings suggest that the Tol-Pal system is important for cell morphology, antibiotic resistance, and virulence of A. baumannii.	2023 Jan	Josephine Joy Hubloher, Lisa Van der Sande, Christoph Schaudinn, Volker Müller, Beate Averhoff	Int Microbiol
36257427	Transmission of antibiotic resistance genes through mobile genetic elements in Acinetobacter baumannii and gene-transfer prevention.	Antibiotic resistance is a major global public health concern. Acinetobacter baumannii is a nosocomial pathogen that has emerged as a global threat because of its high levels of resistance to many antibiotics, particularly those considered as last-resort antibiotics, such as carbapenems. Mobile genetic elements (MGEs) play an important role in the dissemination and expression of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), including the mobilization of ARGs within and between species. We conducted an in-depth, systematic investigation of the occurrence and dissemination of ARGs associated with MGEs in A. baumannii. We focused on a cross-sectoral approach that integrates humans, animals, and environments. Four strategies for the prevention of ARG dissemination through MGEs have been discussed: prevention of airborne transmission of ARGs using semi-permeable membrane-covered thermophilic composting; application of nanomaterials for the removal of emerging pollutants (antibiotics) and pathogens; tertiary treatment technologies for controlling ARGs and MGEs in wastewater treatment plants; and the removal of ARGs by advanced oxidation techniques. This review contemplates and evaluates the major drivers involved in the transmission of ARGs from the cross-sectoral perspective and ARG-transfer prevention processes.	2023 Jan	Jeong Ho Jeon, Kyung-Min Jang, Jung Hun Lee, Lin-Woo Kang, Sang Hee Lee	Sci Total Environ
35908655	Immunoinformatics-guided designing of epitope-based subunit vaccine from Pilus assembly protein of Acinetobacter baumannii bacteria.	Acinetobacter baumannii, a prominent pathogen responsible for chronic infections in the blood, urinary tract, and lungs, has a high mortality due to its virulence and limited preventive methods. The present study aims to characterize the pilus assembly protein of A. baumannii to offer leads for epitope-based vaccine development. FilF is the putative pilus assembly protein that reportedly plays a supreme character in the virulence of this WHO-listed ESKAPE bacterium. Implementing various bioinformatics tools, led to the recognition of many antigenic B and T cell epitopes. Most promising B and T-cell epitopes were selected based on their binding efficiency with commonly occurring MHC alleles. Finally, we stepped down to fourteen protective antigenic peptides. These epitopes were also revealed to be non-allergenic and non-toxic. As a result, a vaccine chimera was created by linking these epitopes with appropriate linkers and adjuvant such as β-defensins. Furthermore, homology modeling and validation were carried out, with the modeled structure being employed for molecular docking with the immunological receptor (TLR-4) found on lymphocyte cells. As a result of the molecular dynamics simulation, the interaction between human TLR-4 and the multi-epitope vaccine sequence was stable. Finally, in silico cloning and immune simulation were carried out to see the efficacy of the construct vaccine. This is the first study targeting the pilus assembly protein from A. baumannii to identify novel epitopes that hold potential for further experimental design of multi-peptide vaccine construct against the pathogen.	2022 Sep	Soumya Ranjan Mahapatra, Jyotirmayee Dey, Aryan Jaiswal, Riya Roy, Namrata Misra, Mrutyunjay Suar	J Immunol Methods
37111234	Rifampicin Enhanced Carbapenem Activity with Improved Antibacterial Effects and Eradicates Established <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> Biofilms.	Biofilm-mediated infections are critical to public health and a leading cause of resistance among pathogens, amounting to a prolonged hospital stay and increased mortality rate in the intensive care unit. In this study, the antibacterial and antibiofilm activities of rifampicin or carbapenem monotherapies were compared with rifampicin and carbapenem combination therapies against rifampicin-resistant and carbapenem-resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> isolates. Among 29 CRAB isolates, 24/29 (83%) were resistant to rifampicin, with MIC values between 2-256 µg/mL. Checkerboard assays disclosed that combination therapies at FICIs between 1/8 and 1/4 improved the activity of carbapenems at subinhibitory concentrations. Time-kill kinetics indicated a 2- to 4-log reduction at 1/2 MIC rifampicin + 1/4 MIC carbapenem and 1/4 MIC rifampicin + 1/4 MIC carbapenem against the isolates, with the MIC values ranging from 2-8 µg/mL. The MTT assay revealed a dose-dependent decrease of the cell viability of established bacterial biofilm at 4 MIC rifampicin + 2 MIC carbapenems, with a percentage reduction of 44-75%, compared with monotherapies at 16 MIC. Scanning electron microscopy further confirmed bacterial cell membrane disruption, suggesting a synergism between carbapenem and rifampicin against a representative isolate. The findings demonstrated that the combination of rifampicin with carbapenems could improve antibacterial activities and eradicate established <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> biofilm.	2023 Mar	Lois Chinwe Nwabor, Arnon Chukamnerd, Ozioma Forstinus Nwabor, Rattanaruji Pomwised, Supayang P Voravuthikunchai, Sarunyou Chusri	Pharmaceuticals (Basel)
36831915	Silver Nanostar-Based SERS for the Discrimination of Clinically Relevant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> and <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i> Species and Clones.	The development of rapid, reliable, and low-cost methods that enable discrimination among clinically relevant bacteria is crucial, with emphasis on those listed as WHO Global Priority 1 Critical Pathogens, such as carbapenem-resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> and carbapenem-resistant or ESBL-producing <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i>. To address this problem, we developed and validated a protocol of surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) with silver nanostars for the discrimination of <i>A. baumannii</i> and <i>K. pneumoniae</i> species, and their globally disseminated and clinically relevant antibiotic resistant clones. Isolates were characterized by mixing bacterial colonies with silver nanostars, followed by deposition on filter paper for SERS spectrum acquisition. Spectral data were processed with unsupervised and supervised multivariate data analysis methods, including principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least-squares discriminant analysis (PLSDA), respectively. Our proposed SERS procedure using silver nanostars adsorbed to the bacteria, followed by multivariate data analysis, enabled differentiation between and within species. This pilot study demonstrates the potential of SERS for the rapid discrimination of clinically relevant <i>A. baumannii</i> and <i>K. pneumoniae</i> species and clones, displaying several advantages such as the ease of silver nanostars synthesis and the possible use of a handheld spectrometer, which makes this approach ideal for point-of-care applications.	2023 Jan	Miguel Peixoto de Almeida, Carla Rodrigues, Ângela Novais, Filipa Grosso, Nicolae Leopold, Luísa Peixe, Ricardo Franco, Eulália Pereira	Biosensors (Basel)
36361923	Complementary Regulation of BfmRS Two-Component and AbaIR Quorum Sensing Systems to Express Virulence-Associated Genes in <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>.	<i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> expresses various virulence factors to adapt to hostile environments and infect susceptible hosts. This study investigated the regulatory network of the BfmRS two-component and AbaIR quorum sensing (QS) systems in the expression of virulence-associated genes in <i>A. baumannii</i> ATCC 17978. The Δ<i>bfmS</i> mutant exhibited a significant decrease in surface motility, which presumably resulted from the low expression of <i>pilT</i> and <i>A1S_0112</i>-<i>A1S_0119</i> gene cluster. The Δ<i>bfmR</i> mutant displayed a significant reduction in biofilm and pellicle formation due to the low expression of <i>csu</i> operon. The deletion of <i>abaR</i> did not affect the expression of <i>bfmR</i> or <i>bfmS</i>. However, the expression of <i>abaR</i> and <i>abaI</i> was upregulated in the Δ<i>bfmR</i> mutant. The Δ<i>bfmR</i> mutant also produced more autoinducers than did the wild-type strain, suggesting that BfmR negatively regulates the AbaIR QS system. The Δ<i>bfmS</i> mutant exhibited no autoinducer production in the bioassay system. The expression of the <i>A1S_0112-A1S_0119</i> gene cluster was downregulated in the Δ<i>abaR</i> mutant, whereas the expression of <i>csu</i> operon was upregulated in this mutant with a high cell density. In conclusion, for the first time, we demonstrated that the BfmRS-AbaIR QS system axis regulated the expression of virulence-associated genes in <i>A. baumannii</i>. This study provides new insights into the complex network system involved in the regulation of virulence-associated genes underlying the pathogenicity of <i>A. baumannii</i>.	2022 Oct	Hyo-Jeong Kim, Na-Yeong Kim, Seo-Yeon Ko, Seong-Yong Park, Man-Hwan Oh, Min-Sang Shin, Yoo-Chul Lee, Je-Chul Lee	Int J Mol Sci
36868326	Peptidoglycan-associated lipoprotein contributes to the virulence of Acinetobacter baumannii and serves as a vaccine candidate.	The role of peptidoglycan-associated lipoprotein (Pal) in A. baumannii pathogenesis remains unclear. Here, we illustrated its role by constructing a pal deficient A. baumannii mutant and its complementary strain.Transcriptome analysis of the WT and pal mutant revealed a total of 596 differentially expressed genes. Gene Ontology analysis revealed that pal deficiency caused the downregulation of genes related to material transport and metabolic processes. The pal mutant showed a slower growth and was sensitive to detergent and serum killing compared to WT strain, whereas, the complemented pal mutant showed rescued phenotype. The pal mutant caused decreased mortality in mice pneumonia infection compared to WT strain, while the complemented pal mutant showed increased mortality. Mice immunized with recombinant Pal showed 40% protection against A. baumannii-mediated pneumonia. Collectively, these data indicate Pal is a virulence factor of A. baumannii and may serve as a potential target for preventive or therapeutic interventions.	2023 Mar	Xi Zeng, Ning Wang, Chuanying Xiang, Qiang Liu, Daiyu Li, Yangyang Zhou, Xiaomin Zhang, Yu Xie, Weijun Zhang, Hong Yang, Ming Jiang, Xianchun Zong, Quanming Zou, Yun Shi	Genomics

36920961	Differential proteomic analysis and pathogenic effects of outer membrane vesicles derived from Acinetobacter baumannii under normoxia and hypoxia.	Acinetobacter baumannii is a major causative agent of nosocomial infections and its outer membrane vesicles (AbOMVs) have been shown to be involved in pathogenicity by transporting virulence factors and transferring information for communication between pathogens and host cells. Despite the fact that the infected sites of A. baumannii such as lungs and skin soft tissues are hypoxic, most studies on AbOMV virulence have used AbOMVs prepared under aerobic conditions. The present study aims to elucidate the protein profile and pathogenic impact of AbOMVs released under hypoxic condition. AbOMVs were isolated from A. baumannii under normoxic and hypoxic conditions, and their protein profiles were compared. The different effects of both normoxic and hypoxic AbOMVs in cytokine response from mouse macrophages, cytotoxicity to the human lung epithelial cells, and bacterial invasion were then investigated. Our results showed that A. baumannii under hypoxia released larger amounts of OMVs with different protein profiles. Although the cytotoxic effect of AbOMVs from normoxia and hypoxia were comparable, AbOMVs from normoxia induced higher TNF-α production and invasion of Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa than those from hypoxia. On the other hand, AbOMVs significantly enhanced A. baumannii invasion into lung epithelial cells in a dose-dependent manner. These results clearly demonstrate that AbOMVs released from normoxic and hypoxic have different impacts in pathogenesis. This finding provides new insight into the complex interactions between A. baumannii, coinfecting pathogens and host cells via OMVs, in particular the different pathogenic effects of AbOMVs under normoxic and hypoxic conditions.	2023	Sachio Suzuki, Phawinee Subsomwong, Kouji Narita, Noriaki Kawai, Takahito Ishiai, Wei Teng, Rojana Sukchawalit, Akio Nakane, Sadatomo Tasaka, Krisana Asano	PLoS One
36317921	PBP1A Directly Interacts with the Divisome Complex to Promote Septal Peptidoglycan Synthesis in Acinetobacter baumannii.	The class A penicillin-binding proteins (aPBPs), PBP1A and PBP1B, are major peptidoglycan synthases that synthesize more than half of the peptidoglycan per generation in Escherichia coli. Whereas aPBPs have distinct roles in peptidoglycan biosynthesis during growth (i.e., elongation and division), they are semiredundant; disruption of either is rescued by the other to maintain envelope homeostasis and promote proper growth. Acinetobacter baumannii is a nosocomial pathogen that has a high propensity to overcome antimicrobial treatment. A. baumannii contains both PBP1A and PBP1B (encoded by <i>mrcA</i> and <i>mrcB</i>, respectively), but only <i>mrcA</i> deletion decreased fitness and contributed to colistin resistance through inactivation of lipooligosaccharide biosynthesis, indicating that PBP1B was not functionally redundant with the PBP1A activity. While previous studies suggested a distinct role for PBP1A in division, it was unknown whether its role in septal peptidoglycan biosynthesis was direct. Here, we show that A. baumannii PBP1A has a direct role in division through interactions with divisome components. PBP1A localizes to septal sites during growth, where it interacts with the transpeptidase PBP3, an essential division component that regulates daughter cell formation. PBP3 overexpression was sufficient to rescue the division defect in Δ<i>mrcA</i> A. baumannii; however, PBP1A overexpression was not sufficient to rescue the septal defect when PBP3 was inhibited, suggesting that their activity is not redundant. Overexpression of a major dd-carboxypeptidase, PBP5, also restored the canonical A. baumannii coccobacilli morphology in Δ<i>mrcA</i> cells. Together, these data support a direct role for PBP1A in A. baumannii division and highlights its role as a septal peptidoglycan synthase. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Peptidoglycan biosynthesis is a validated target of β-lactam antibiotics, and it is critical that we understand essential processes in multidrug-resistant pathogens such as Acinetobacter baumannii. While model systems such as Escherichia coli have shown that PBP1A is associated with side wall peptidoglycan synthesis, we show herein that A. baumannii PBP1A directly interacts with the divisome component PBP3 to promote division, suggesting a unique role for the enzyme in this highly drug-resistant nosocomial pathogen. A. baumannii demonstrated unanticipated resistance and tolerance to envelope-targeting antibiotics, which may be driven by rewired peptidoglycan machinery and may underlie therapeutic failure during antibiotic treatment.	2022 Dec	Katie N Kang, Joseph M Boll	J Bacteriol
36151303	Novel D-form of hybrid peptide (D-AP19) rapidly kills Acinetobacter baumannii while tolerating proteolytic enzymes.	Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are being developed as potent alternative treatments to conventional antibiotics which are unlikely to induce bacterial resistance. They can be designed and modified to possess several druggable properties. We report herein a novel hybrid peptide of modified aurein (A3) and cathelicidin (P7), or A3P7, by a flipping technique. It exhibited potent antibacterial activity against both Gram-negative and -positive pathogenic bacteria but had moderate hemolytic activity. To reduce the sequence length and toxicity, C-terminal truncation was serially performed and eight truncated derivatives (AP12-AP19) were obtained. They had significantly less hemolytic activity while preserving antibacterial activity. Secondary structures of the candidate peptides in environments simulating bacterial membranes (30 mM SDS and 50% TFE), determined by CD spectroscopy, showed α-helical structures consistent with predicted in silico 3D structural models. Among the peptides, AP19 demonstrated the best combination of broad-spectrum antibacterial activity (including toward Acinetobacter baumannii) and minimal hemolytic and cytotoxic activities. A D-form peptide (D-AP19), in which all L-enantiomers were substituted with the D-enantiomers, maintained antibacterial activity in the presence of pepsin, trypsin, proteinase K and human plasma. Both isomers exhibited potent antibacterial activity against multi-drug (MDR) and extensively-drug resistant (XDR) clinical isolates of A. baumannii comparable to the traditional antibiotic, meropenem. D-AP19 displayed rapid killing via membrane disruption and leakage of intracellular contents. Additionally, it showed a low tendency to induce bacterial resistance. Our work suggested that D-AP19 could be further optimized and developed as a novel compound potentially for fighting against MDR or XDR A. baumannii.	2022 Sep	Phanvimon Jariyarattanarach, Natthaporn Klubthawee, Mathira Wongchai, Sittiruk Roytrakul, Ratchaneewan Aunpad	Sci Rep

35141834	Spread of multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii isolates belonging to IC1 and IC5 major clones in Rondônia state.	In Brazil, carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii (CRAB) is a critical pathogen showing high carbapenem resistance rates. Currently, there is little epidemiological data on A. baumannii isolated in the Northern Brazilian region. Herein, this study aimed to characterize the resistance mechanisms of CRAB isolates recovered from hospitalized patients in the state of Rondônia in 2019. Most of CRAB were considered as extensively drug-resistant, and some of them showed high MICs for minocycline. Only polymyxins showed a satisfactory activity. All isolates carried bla<sub>OXA-23</sub> and were included in 14 distinct clusters, with the predominance of clonal group A (29%). The IC1 was the most frequent clonal group, followed by IC5 and IC4. Here, we firstly reported the epidemiological scenario of CRAB in the state of Rondônia, located in the Brazilian Amazon region. The high frequency of CRAB presenting XDR phenotype is of great concern, due to limited therapeutical options, especially in the actual pandemic scenario, in which we observed an overcrowding of ICU beds. Such results are essential to better characterize the epidemiology of CRAB in the entire Brazilian territory.	2022 Jun	Tiago Barcelos Valiatti, Tatiane Silva Carvalho, Fernanda Fernandes Santos, Carolina Silva Nodari, Rodrigo Cayô, Juliana Thalita Paulino da Silva, Cicileia Correia da Silva, Jacqueline Andrade Ferreira, Lorena Brandhuber Moura, Levy Assis Dos Santos, Ana Cristina Gales	Braz J Microbiol
36341004	The significant role of Carbapenems-resistant <i>Acinetobacter Baumannii</i> in mortality rate of patients with COVID-19.	<b>Background:</b> Infections caused by <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>, especially carbapenem-resistant (CR) strains, pose important challenges in patients with COVID-19 infection. Therefore, in the present study, we investigated co-infection and antimicrobial resistance patterns, as well as the role of <i>A. baumannii</i> in the outcome of patients with COVID-19. <b>Materials and methods:</b> Between February 2019 and January 2021, 141 patients with <i>A. baumannii</i> infections were detected from seven different hospitals (A to G) in Arak, Iran, and the antibacterial susceptibility pattern of these isolates was evaluated using disk diffusion and E-test methods. Forty-seven of these patients were co-infected with COVID-19. During the study, the data about the clinical course, demographic data, and the role of <i>A. baumannii</i> infections in the mortality rate of COVID-19 patients were collected. <b>Results:</b> Hospitals A and B reported the most patients, with 53 (38%) and 47 (33%), respectively. Additionally, most cases (105 cases, 75%) were reported from surgical and general ICUs. Mechanical ventilators were detected as predisposing factors in 95 (67%) patients, and infection was detected in 20% of patients on the 10th day after intubation. All of the <i>A. baumannii</i> isolates were resistant to different classes of antibiotics, such as carbapenems. Notably, 33% (47 patients) were also positive for COVID-19, and 68% (32 patients) died due to the infection. Statistical analysis showed a significant role of <i>A. baumannii</i> co-infection in the mortality rate of COVID-19 patients (p-value 0.05). <b>Conclusion:</b> co-infection with <i>A. baumannii</i> is one of the most important challenges in COVID-19 patients. Our results showed that all isolated bacteria were CR and significantly increased mortality rates in COVID-19 patients.	2023	Ali AliMohammadi, Nahid Chezani-Sharahi, Zahra Asgari Hezaveh, Elnaz Abbasi, Aref Shariati, Ehsanollah Ghaznavi-Rad	Vacunas
36986332	Dissemination of Clinical <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> Isolate to Hospital Environment during the COVID-19 Pandemic.	The aim of this study was to find the source of <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> in the intensive care unit (ICU) after an outbreak during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, as there was no <i>A. baumannii</i> detected on usually screened susceptible surfaces. The screening of the ICU environment was done in April 2021 when eleven different samples were taken. One <i>A. baumannii</i> isolate was recovered from the air conditioner and was compared with four clinical <i>A. baumannii</i> isolates obtained from patients hospitalized in January 2021. Isolates were confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS), minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined, and the multilocus sequence typing (MLST) was performed. The molecular identification of <i>A. baumannii</i> isolates as ST208, the presence of the same <i>bla</i><sub>OXA-23</sub> carbapenemase gene, and the same antibiotic susceptibility profile suggest that the isolate recovered from the air conditioner is the same as the isolates recovered from hospitalized patients. The environmental isolate was recovered three months later than the clinical isolates, emphasizing the ability of <i>A. baumannii</i> to survive on dry abiotic surfaces. The air conditioner in the clinical environment is an important but undoubtedly neglected source of <i>A. baumannii</i> outbreaks, hence, frequent disinfection of hospital air conditioners with appropriate disinfectants is mandatory to mitigate the circulation of <i>A. baumannii</i> between patients and the hospital environment.	2023 Mar	Emina Pustijanac, Jasna Hrenović, Mirna Vranić-Ladavac, Martina Močenić, Natalie Karčić, Lorena Lazarić Stefanović, Irena Hrstić, Jasenka Lončarić, Martina Šeruga Musić, Marina Drčelić, Dijana Majstorović, Ines Kovačić	Pathogens

36551364	Colistin Monotherapy versus Colistin plus Sitafloxacin for Therapy of Carbapenem-Resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> Infections: A Preliminary Study.	The in vitro study of sitafloxacin against carbapenem-resistant (CR) <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> demonstrated activity against most strains of CR <i>A. baumannii</i>, and the combination of colistin and sitafloxacin showed an in vitro synergistic effect against CR <i>A. baumannii</i>. This study aimed to compare efficacy and safety between colistin plus sitafloxacin with colistin alone for therapy for CR <i>A. baumannii</i> infection. This randomized controlled trial enrolled 56 patients with CR <i>A. baumannii</i> infection (28/group) during 2018-2021, and the treatment duration was 7-14 days. The study outcomes were 28-day mortality, clinical and microbiological responses, and adverse events. There was no significant difference in 28-day mortality between groups (32.1% combination vs. 32.1% monotherapy, <i>p</i> = 1.000). Favorable clinical response at the end of treatment was comparable between groups (81.5% combination vs. 77.8% monotherapy, <i>p</i> = 0.788). Microbiological response at the end of treatment was also comparable between groups (73.1% combination vs. 74.1% monotherapy, <i>p</i> = 0.934). Acute kidney injury was found in 53.8% of the combination group, and in 45.8% of the monotherapy group (<i>p</i> = 0.571). In conclusion, there was no significant difference in 28-day mortality between the colistin monotherapy and the colistin plus sitafloxacin groups. There was also no significant difference in adverse events between groups.	2022 Nov	Rujipas Sirijatuphat, Supawas Thawornkaew, Darat Ruangkriengsin, Visanu Thamlikitkul	Antibiotics (Basel)
37099644	Unveiling MurE ligase potential inhibitors for treating multi-drug resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>.	<i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> is an opportunistic pathogen with ability to cause serious infection such as bacteremia, ventilator associated pneumonia, and wound infections. As strains of <i>A. baumannii</i> are resistant to almost all clinically used antibiotics and with the emergence of carbapenems resistant phenotypes warrants the search for novel antibiotics. Considering this, herein, a series of computer aided drug designing approach was utilized to search novel chemical scaffolds that bind stronger to MurE ligase enzyme of <i>A. baumannii</i>, which is involved peptidoglycan synthesis. The work identified LAS_22461675, LAS_34000090 and LAS_51177972 compounds as promising binding molecules with MurE enzyme having binding energy score of -10.5 kcal/mol, -9.3 kcal/mol and -8.6 kcal/mol, respectively. The compounds were found to achieve docked inside the MurE substrate binding pocket and established close distance chemical interactions. The interaction energies were dominated by van der Waals and less contributions were seen from hydrogen bonding energy. The dynamic simulation assay predicted the complexes stable with no major global and local changes noticed. The docked stability was also validated by MM/PBSA and MM/GBSA binding free energy methods. The net MM/GBSA binding free energy of LAS_22461675 complex, LAS_34000090 complex and LAS_51177972 complex is -26.25 kcal/mol, -27.23 kcal/mol and -29.64 kcal/mol, respectively. Similarly in case of MM-PBSA, the net energy value was in following order; LAS_22461675 complex (-27.67 kcal/mol), LAS_34000090 complex (-29.94 kcal/mol) and LAS_51177972 complex (-27.32 kcal/mol). The AMBER entropy and WaterSwap methods also confirmed stable complexes formation. Further, molecular features of the compounds were determined that predicted compounds to have good druglike properties and pharmacokinetic favorable. The study concluded the compounds to good candidates to be tested by <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i> experimental assays.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

35595789	Different clinical characteristics and impact of carbapenem-resistance on outcomes between Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteraemia: a prospective observational study.	This study aimed to evaluate the differences in clinical characteristics and impact of carbapenem resistance (CR) on outcomes between Acinetobacter baumannii (Ab) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa) bacteraemia. We prospectively identified all patients with Ab and Pa bacteraemia in 10 hospitals over 1 year. Treatment failure was defined as all-cause 30-day mortality, persistent bacteraemia, or recurrent bacteraemia within 30 days. We included 304 Ab and 241 Pa bacteraemia cases. CR was detected in 216 patients (71%) with Ab bacteraemia and 55 patients (23%) with Pa bacteraemia. Treatment failure was significantly higher in CR-Ab than in CR-Pa (60.6% vs. 34.5%, P = 0.001). In Ab, severe sepsis or septic shock and high Pitt bacteraemia score were independent risk factors for treatment failure in the inappropriate empirical antibiotics group. In Pa, hospital-acquired infection and high Pitt bacteraemia score were independent risk factors for treatment failure in both groups. CR was an independent risk factor in Ab for treatment failure in both groups, but not in Pa bacteraemia. We demonstrated significant differences in clinical characteristics and impact of CR on clinical outcomes between Ab and Pa bacteraemia, suggesting that different treatment approaches may be needed.	2022 May	Chan Mi Lee, Young-Jun Kim, Sook-In Jung, Seong Eun Kim, Wan Beom Park, Pyoeng Gyun Choe, Eu Suk Kim, Chung-Jong Kim, Hee Jung Choi, Shinwon Lee, Sun Hee Lee, Younghee Jung, Ji Hwan Bang, Shinhye Cheon, Yee Gyung Kwak, Yu Min Kang, Kyung-Hwa Park, Kyoung-Ho Song, Hong Bin Kim, Korea INfectious Diseases (KIND) Study Group	Sci Rep
36383290	In vitro virulence activity of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, enhanced by either Acinetobacter baumannii or Enterococcus faecium through the polymicrobial interactions.	Microbes within an infection impact neighbors' pathogenicity. This study aimed to address in vitro virulence activity of Pseudomonas aeruginosa under the binary interaction with Acinetobacter baumannii or Enterococcus faecium, co-isolated from two chronic wound infections. The biofilm formation of Pseudomonas was enhanced 1.5- and 1.4-fold when it was simultaneously cultured with Acinetobacter and Enterococcus, respectively. Pseudomonas motility was increased by 1.9- and 1.5-fold (swimming), 3.6- and 1.9-fold (swarming), and 1.5- and 1.5-fold (twitching) in the dual cultures with Acinetobacter and Enterococcus, respectively. The synergistic hemolysis activity of Pseudomonas was observed with the heat-killed Acinetobacter and Enterococcus cells. The minimum inhibitory concentration of ciprofloxacin against Pseudomonas was increased from (μg mL<sup>-1</sup>) 25 to 400 in the individual and mixed cultures, respectively. The pyocyanin production by Pseudomonas in the single and mixed cultures with Acinetobacter and Enterococcus was (μg/mL) 1.8, 2.3, and 2.9, respectively. The expression of lasI, rhlI, and pqsR genes was up-regulated by 1.0-, 1.9-, and 16.3-fold, and 4.9-, 1.0-, and 9.3-fold when Pseudomonas was incubated with Acinetobacter and Enterococcus, respectively. Considering the entire community instead of a single pathogen may lead to a more effective therapeutic design for persistent infections caused by Pseudomonas.	2022 Nov	Ghazale Laliany, Saeid Amel Jamehdar, Ali Makhdoumi	Arch Microbiol
36658486	Local characteristics of molecular epidemiolgy of Acinetobacter baumannii in Jilin province (northeast China).	A. Baumannii is an opportunistic nosocomial pathogen which has severe antibiotic resistance. However, the epidemiology is less clearly understood in Jilin province and China. Thus, 89 A. baumannii isolates from a single hospital in Jilin province between 2013-2017 were performed by MLST. In order to better understanding of the epidemiology of Jilin isolates, Chinese strains originated from other domestic regions and worldwide isolates in MLST database were analyzed by silico phylogenetic tools together. A total of 22 STs in Jilin were identified, and 10 STs were found to be novel. The top three predominant sequence types are ST195 (n = 34, 38.2%), ST208 (n = 14, 15.7%) and ST540 (n = 13, 14.6%). ST369 is predicted to be group founder and ST195, ST540 are subgroup founders of the majority STs in Jilin Province. Some newly discovered singletons showed close relationship with strains from other countries, which suggest that nation-cross transmission is one of important origin of Jilin strains. The majority of Jilin STs showed clonality and close relationship with the majorities from other regions of China. But occupation of individual STs in Jilin were different from that of other domestic regions. The aggregation trend and genetic relationship proved that predominant Jilin STs continue to mutate during transmission. Drug resistance facilitated transmission of Jilin A.baumannii isolates because more than 94% of isolates are resistant to at least one carbapenem and the STs with strong resistance to carbapenems usually has more isolates. In conclusion, high diversity and different occupation of STs, and occupation of novel STs proved that epidemiology of A. baumannii in Jilin has special regional characteristics, and drug resistance facilitated transmission of domestic strains and foreign strains.	2023 Jan	Qingsong You, Xue Du, Nannan Hu, Yusi Zhang, Na Zhang, Fusheng Wang, Jinghua Li, Yanbo Sun, Fang Wang, Hongyan Shi	BMC Microbiol
36432857	Synergistic Effects of Some Methoxyflavones Extracted from Rhizome of <i>Kaempferia parviflora</i> Combined with Gentamicin against Carbapenem-Resistant Strains of <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i>, <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>, and <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>.	The present study aimed to investigate the antibacterial activity of ethanolic <i>Kaempferia parviflora</i> extracts and the combined effects of the plant's specific compounds with gentamicin against clinical strains of carbapenem-resistant <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i>, <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>, and <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>. The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of gentamicin and <i>Kaempferia parviflora</i> extracts against the tested bacterial strains were determined by using broth microdilution. The combined effects of <i>Kaempferia parviflora</i> extract and gentamicin were investigated by using a checkerboard assay and expressed as a fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI). Crude ethanolic extract of <i>Kaempferia parviflora</i> showed the lowest median values of MIC towards the tested isolates (<i>n</i> = 10) of these tested bacteria at doses of 64 µg/mL, compared to those of other <i>Kaempferia extracts</i>. Among the isolated compounds, only three compounds, namely 3,5,7-trimethoxyflavone, 3,5,7,3'4'-pentamethoxyflavone, and 5,7,4'-trimethoxyflavone, were identified by NMR structural analysis. According to their FICIs, the synergistic effects of gentamicin combined with 3,5,7,3'4'-pentamethoxyflavone were approximately 90%, 90%, and 80% of tested carbapenem-resistant <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i> (CRKP), <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> (CRPA), and <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> (CRAB), respectively. The present study concluded that 3,5,7,3'4'-pentamethoxyflavone extracted from <i>Kaempferia parviflora</i> potentiated the antibacterial action of gentamicin to combat bacterial resistance against the tested bacteria.	2022 Nov	Siriwoot Sookkhee, Choompone Sakonwasun, Pitchaya Mungkornasawakul, Phadungkiat Khamnoi, Nitwara Wikan, Wutigri Nimlamool	Plants (Basel)

36936223	Case report: <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> septic arthritis in an immunocompetent infant.	<i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> is a gram-negative coccobacilli, mainly causing nosocomial infections with poor prognosis, especially in patients with prolonged hospitalization or antibiotics administration. <i>A. baumannii</i> pneumonia is the most common clinical form and usually occurs in critically ill patients in the intensive care unit. However, septic arthritis caused by <i>A. baumannii</i> is rarely reported. In this report, we describe a case of <i>A. baumannii</i> septic arthritis combined with incomplete Kawasaki disease in an infant. The child's chief complaint was a 2-week intermittent fever with poor response to antibiotics. Initial physical examination revealed swollen lymph nodes in the neck, pharynx congestion, and the appearance of rashes. Combined with laboratory tests, the diagnosis of incomplete Kawasaki disease was considered. After administration of high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin and corticosteroids, the child's fever improved and periungual desquamation appeared simultaneously. Swelling of the right knee occurred 5 days after the fever improved and imaging tests of MRI and ultrasound suggested the existence of infection. A diagnosis of septic arthritis was established subsequently, and arthroscopy was carried out. <i>A. baumannii</i> was finally identified by metagenomics next-generation sequencing of joint draining fluid for pathogenic microorganisms. Treatment with meropenem was then started. The patient eventually recovered and was discharged from the hospital after 23 days of treatment with meropenem. Although <i>A. baumannii</i> is not a common bacterium of septic arthritis, this rare infection can still occur in infants. Early diagnosis, pathogenic identification, and target antibiotic treatment are important to reduce the occurrence of joint sequelae.	2023	Yi Liao, Jiapeng Xiao, Feng Fang, Hua Zhou, Lingling Liu, Xinglou Liu	Front Med (Lausanne)

36463365	Acinetobacter baumannii reinforces the pathogenesis by promoting IL-17 production in a mouse pneumonia model.	Interleukin-17 (IL-17) is involved in host defense against bacterial infection. Little is known about the role of IL-17 in A. baumannii-infected pneumonia. Our objective was to investigate the role of IL-17 in pulmonary A. baumannii infection in a mouse model. We infected C57BL/6 mice intra-tracheally (i.t.) with A. baumannii to establish pneumonia model and found A. baumannii infection elevated IL-17 expression in lungs. IL-17-deficient (Il17<sup>-/-</sup>) mice were resistant to pulmonary A. baumannii infection, showing improved mice survival, reduced bacteria burdens, and alleviated lung inflammation. Further, treatment of A. baumannii-infected Il17<sup>-/-</sup> mice with IL-17 exacerbated the severity of pneumonia. These data suggest a pathogenic role of IL-17 in pulmonary A. baumannii infection. Further, the infiltration and phagocytic function of neutrophils in broncho-alveolar lavage fluid were detected by flow cytometry. The results showed that Il17<sup>-/-</sup> mice had increased neutrophil infiltration and enhanced phagocytosis in neutrophils at the early time of infection. Treatment of mice with IL-17 suppressed phagocytic function of neutrophils. All data suggest that IL-17 promotes susceptibility of mice to pulmonary A. baumannii infection by suppressing neutrophil phagocytosis at early time of infection. Targeting IL-17 might be a potential therapeutic strategy in controlling the outcome of A. baumannii pneumonia.	2023 Feb	Yangyang Zhou, Chuanying Xiang, Ning Wang, Xiaomin Zhang, Yu Xie, Hong Yang, Gang Guo, Kaiyun Liu, Yan Li, Yun Shi	Med Microbiol Immunol
35861511	Constitutive Phenotypic Modification of Lipid A in Clinical Acinetobacter baumannii Isolates.	The degree of polymyxin B (PMB) resistance was measured in 40 clinical Acinetobacter baumannii isolates obtained from health care facilities. All of the tested isolates possessed a multidrug-resistant (MDR) phenotype against four classes of antibiotics (meropenem, doxycycline, gentamicin, and erythromycin), except for PMB. The <i>bla</i><sub>OXA-23</sub> gene was detected throughout the genetic analysis and experimental assay, indicating that all of the MDR strains were carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii strains. Multilocus sequence typing-based genotyping revealed that nine selected strains belonged to the international clone II lineage. When matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry was performed, intrinsic lipid A modification by phosphoethanolamine (PEtN) incorporation was noticeable only in the PMB-resistant (PMB<sup>R</sup>) strains. However, the presence of hexa- and penta-acylated lipid A due to the loss of the laurate (C<sub>12</sub>) acyl chain was noted in all PMB-susceptible strains but not in the PMB<sup>R</sup> strains. The reduction of negative surface charges in the PMB<sup>R</sup> strains was assessed by zeta potential analysis. Fluorescence imaging using dansyl-PMB revealed that, in the PMB<sup>R</sup> strains, PMB was less likely to bind to the cell surface. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> The widespread presence of MDR pathogens, including A. baumannii, is causing serious hospital-acquired infections worldwide. Extensive surveillance of MDR clinical A. baumannii isolates has been conducted, but the underlying mechanisms for their development of MDR phenotypes are often neglected. Either lipid A modification or loss of lipopolysaccharide in Gram-negative bacteria leads to PMB<sup>R</sup> phenotypes. The prevalence of intrinsic lipid A modification in PMB<sup>R</sup> clinical strains was attributed to high levels of basal expression of <i>pmrC</i> and <i>eptA-1</i>. Our findings suggest that new therapeutic strategies are warranted to combat MDR pathogens due to the emergence of many PMB<sup>R</sup> clinical strains.	2022 Aug	Su-Hyun Kim, Sohyeon Yun, Woojun Park	Microbiol Spectr
36687622	Colistin potentiation in multidrug-resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> by a non-cytotoxic guanidine derivative of silver.	A novel nano-formulation (NF) that sensitizes <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> (AB) to otherwise ineffective colistin is described in the present study. Infections due to multidrug resistant (MDR) AB represent a major therapeutic challenge, especially in situations of pre-existing colistin resistance (colR). Subsequently, boosting the effectiveness of colistin would be a better alternative tactic to treat AB infections rather than discovering a new class of antibiotics. We have previously demonstrated an NF comprising self-assembled guanidinium and ionic silver nanoparticles [AD-L@Ag(0)] to have anti-biofilm and bactericidal activity. We report NF AD-L@Ag(0) for the very first time for the potentiation of colistin in Gram-negative colistin-resistant bacteria. Our results implied that a combination of clinically relevant concentrations of colistin and AD-L@Ag(0) significantly decreased colistin-resistant AB bacterial growth and viability, which otherwise was elevated in the presence of only colistin. In this study, we have described various combinations of minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of colistin (MICcol, <sup>1/2</sup> MICcol, and <sup>1/4</sup> MICcol) and that of AD-L@Ag(0) [MICAD-L@Ag(0), <sup>1/2</sup> MICAD-L@Ag(0), and <sup>1/4</sup> MICAD-L@Ag(0)] and tested them against MDR AB culture. The results (in broth as well as in solid media) signified that AD-L@Ag(0) was able to potentiate the anti-microbial activity of colistin at sub-MIC concentrations. Furthermore, the viability and metabolic activity of bacterial cells were also measured by CTC fluorescence assay and ATP bioluminescence assay. The results of these assays were in perfect concordance with the scores of cultures (colony forming unit and culture turbidity). In addition, quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed to unveil the expression of selected genes, DNAgyrA, DNAgyrB, and dac. These genes introduce negative supercoiling in the DNA, and hence are important for basic cellular processes. These genes, due to mutation, modified the Lipid A of bacteria, further resisting the uptake of colistin. Therefore, the expression of these genes was upregulated when AB was treated with only colistin, substantiating that AB is resistant to colistin, whereas the combinations of MICcol + MICAD-L@Ag(0) downregulated the expression of these genes, implying that the developed formulation can potentiate the efficiency of colistin. In conclusion, AD-L@Ag(0) can potentiate the proficiency of colistin, further enhancing colistin-mediated death of AB by putatively disrupting the outer membrane (OM) and facilitating bacterial death.	2022	Deepak Kumar, Chaitali Singhal, Manisha Yadav, Pooja Joshi, Priyanka Patra, Subhash Tanwar, Amitava Das, Sumit Kumar Pramanik, Susmita Chaudhuri	Front Microbiol
37113664	A fresh pH-responsive imipenem-loaded nanocarrier against <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> with a synergetic effect.	In recent years, the treatment of <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> infections has become a pressing clinical challenge due to its increasing incidence and its serious pathogenic risk. The research and development of new antibacterial agents for <i>A. baumannii</i> have attracted the attention of the scientific community. Therefore, we have constructed a new pH-responsive antibacterial nano-delivery system (Imi@ZIF-8) for the antibacterial treatment of <i>A. baumannii</i>. Due to its pH-sensitive characteristics, the nano-delivery system offers an improved release of the loaded imipenem antibiotic at the acidic infection site. Based on the high loading capacity and positive charge of the modified ZIF-8 nanoparticles, they are excellent carriers and are suitable for imipenem loading. The Imi@ZIF-8 nanosystem features synergistic antibacterial effects, combining ZIF-8 and imipenem to eliminate <i>A. baumannii</i> through different antibacterial mechanisms. When the loaded imipenem concentration reaches 20 µg/mL, Imi@ZIF-8 is highly effective against <i>A. baumannii in vitro</i>. Imi@ZIF-8 not only inhibits the biofilm formation of <i>A. baumannii</i> but also has a potent killing effect. Furthermore, in mice with celiac disease, the Imi@ZIF-8 nanosystem demonstrates excellent therapeutic efficacy against <i>A. baumannii</i> at imipenem concentrations of 10 mg/kg, and it can inhibit inflammatory reaction and local leukocyte infiltration. Due to its biocompatibility and biosafety, this nano-delivery system is a promising therapeutic strategy in the clinical treatment of <i>A. baumannii</i> infections, providing a new direction for the treatment of antibacterial infections.	2023	Shumin Gui, Xisheng Li, Mingming Feng, Hui Liu, Liwenhui Huang, Xinqing Niu	Front Bioeng Biotechnol
37059703	Repurposing host-guest chemistry to sequester virulence and eradicate biofilms in multidrug resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii.	The limited diversity in targets of available antibiotic therapies has put tremendous pressure on the treatment of bacterial pathogens, where numerous resistance mechanisms that counteract their function are becoming increasingly prevalent. Here, we utilize an unconventional anti-virulence screen of host-guest interacting macrocycles, and identify a water-soluble synthetic macrocycle, Pillar[5]arene, that is non-bactericidal/bacteriostatic and has a mechanism of action that involves binding to both homoserine lactones and lipopolysaccharides, key virulence factors in Gram-negative pathogens. Pillar[5]arene is active against Top Priority carbapenem- and third/fourth-generation cephalosporin-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii, suppressing toxins and biofilms and increasing the penetration and efficacy of standard-of-care antibiotics in combined administrations. The binding of homoserine lactones and lipopolysaccharides also sequesters their direct effects as toxins on eukaryotic membranes, neutralizing key tools that promote bacterial colonization and impede immune defenses, both in vitro and in vivo. Pillar[5]arene evades both existing antibiotic resistance mechanisms, as well as the build-up of rapid tolerance/resistance. The versatility of macrocyclic host-guest chemistry provides ample strategies for tailored targeting of virulence in a wide range of Gram-negative infectious diseases.	2023 Apr	Christopher Jonkergouw, Ngong Kodiah Beyeh, Ekaterina Osmekhina, Katarzyna Leskinen, S Maryamdokht Taimoory, Dmitrii Fedorov, Eduardo Anaya-Plaza, Mauri A Kostiainen, John F Trant, Robin H A Ras, Päivi Saavalainen, Markus B Linder	Nat Commun
36267170	<i>In vitro</i> evaluation of the antimicrobial activity of antiseptics against clinical <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> strains isolated from combat wounds.	Healthcare-associated infections (HCAIs) are among the most prominent medical problems worldwide. In the context of increasing antibiotic resistance globally, the use of antiseptics as the main active agent and potentiator of antibiotics for the treatment of purulent-inflammatory complications of traumatic wounds, burns, and surgical wounds can be considered to tackle opportunistic infections and their prevention during war. This study presents a comparative investigation of the antimicrobial efficacy of antiseptics used for surgical antisepsis and antiseptic treatment of skin, mucous membranes, and wounds against multidrug-resistant clinical isolates of <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> as a wound pathogen of critical priority (according to the WHO). It was found that strains of <i>A. baumannii</i>, which have natural and acquired resistance to antimicrobial drugs, remain susceptible to modern antiseptics. Antiseptic drugs based on decamethoxine, chlorhexidine, octenidine, polyhexanide, and povidone-iodine 10% and 2% provide effective bactericidal activity against <i>A. baumannii</i> within the working concentrations of these drugs. Chlorhexidine and decamethoxine can inhibit biofilm formation by <i>A. baumannii</i> cells. In terms of bactericidal properties and biofilm formation inhibition, chlorhexidine and decamethoxine are the most effective of all tested antiseptics.	2022	Tetyana Valeriyivna Denysko, Oleksandr Adamovych Nazarchuk, Oleksandr Gruzevskyi, Nataliia Ànatoliivna Bahniuk, Dmytro Valeriiovych Dmytriiev, Roman Mykolayovych Chornopyschuk, Vira Volodymyrivna Bebyk	Front Microbiol
36853012	Therapeutic, Humanized Monoclonal Antibody Exhibits Broad Binding and Protective Efficacy against Acinetobacter baumannii.	Acinetobacter baumannii is an extremely drug-resistant pathogen necessitating the development of new therapies. We seek to generate a cocktail of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) that can target the full diversity of A. baumannii isolates. We have newly identified the antibody MAb5. Here, we demonstrate that MAb5 has broad binding against U.S. (<i>n</i> = 300) and international (<i>n</i> = 250) isolates (72.24% and 28.76%, respectively), likely targets O-antigen capsular carbohydrates, and exhibits protective efficacy <i>in vivo</i>.	2023 Mar	Matthew Slarve, Zeferino Reyna, Elizabeth Burk, Juan Ruiz-Delgado, Rachel Li, Jun Yan, Brian Luna, Brad Spellberg	Antimicrob Agents Chemother
35181526	Using engineered water nanostructures (EWNS) for wound disinfection: Case study of Acinetobacter baumannii inactivation on skin and the inhibition of biofilm formation.	Engineered water nanostructures (EWNS) were utilized to deliver a cocktail of nature derived antimicrobials, to assess their efficacy as a solution to the problem of wound infections. The wound related microorganism Acinetobacter baumannii was inoculated on stainless steel and porcine skin and treated with EWNS. EWNS were able to reduce A. baumannii on stainless steel by 4.79 logs in 15 min, and 2 logs in 30 min on porcine skin. The EWNS were able to reduce the strength of A. baumannii biofilm on stainless steel by 87.31% as measured with the XTT assay (P < .001) and 86.27% in cellular counts (P < .001), after two EWNS interventions of 30 min each. Total antimicrobial dose delivered to the surface was 1.42 ng. SEM of biofilms after EWNS treatment showed reduced biomass. These results indicate that the EWNS technology has potential for application in field of wound disinfection and healing.	2022 Jun	Nachiket Vaze, Philip Demokritou	Nanomedicine
36189355	Biofilm formation is not an independent risk factor for mortality in patients with <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> bacteremia.	In the past decades, due to the high prevalence of the antibiotic-resistant isolates of <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>, it has emerged as one of the most troublesome pathogens threatening the global healthcare system. Furthermore, this pathogen has the ability to form biofilms, which is another effective mechanism by which it survives in the presence of antibiotics. However, the clinical impact of biofilm-forming <i>A. baumannii</i> isolates on patients with bacteremia is largely unknown. This retrospective study was conducted at five medical centers in Taiwan over a 9-year period. A total of 252 and 459 patients with bacteremia caused by biofilm- and non-biofilm-forming isolates of <i>A. baumannii</i>, respectively, were enrolled. The clinical demographics, antimicrobial susceptibility, biofilm-forming ability, and patient clinical outcomes were analyzed. The biofilm-forming ability of the isolates was assessed using a microtiter plate assay. Multivariate analysis revealed the higher APACHE II score, shock status, lack of appropriate antimicrobial therapy, and carbapenem resistance of the infected strain were independent risk factors of 28-day mortality in the patients with <i>A. baumannii</i> bacteremia. However, there was no significant difference between the 28-day survival and non-survival groups, in terms of the biofilm forming ability. Compared to the patients infected with non-biofilm-forming isolates, those infected with biofilm-forming isolates had a lower in-hospital mortality rate. Patients with either congestive heart failure, underlying hematological malignancy, or chemotherapy recipients were more likely to become infected with the biofilm-forming isolates. Multivariate analysis showed congestive heart failure was an independent risk factor of infection with biofilm-forming isolates, while those with arterial lines tended to be infected with non-biofilm-forming isolates. There were no significant differences in the sources of infection between the biofilm-forming and non-biofilm-forming isolate groups. Carbapenem susceptibility was also similar between these groups. In conclusion, the patients infected with the biofilm-forming isolates of the <i>A. baumannii</i> exhibited different clinical features than those infected with non-biofilm-forming isolates. The biofilm-forming ability of <i>A. baumannii</i> may also influence the antibiotic susceptibility of its isolates. However, it was not an independent risk factor for a 28-day mortality in the patients with bacteremia.	2022	Tsung-Ta Chiang, Tzu-Wen Huang, Jun-Ren Sun, Shu-Chen Kuo, Aristine Cheng, Chang-Pan Liu, Yuag-Meng Liu, Ya-Sung Yang, Te-Li Chen, Yi-Tzu Lee, Yung-Chih Wang	Front Cell Infect Microbiol
36604462	Characterisation and sequencing of the novel phage Abp95, which is effective against multi-genotypes of carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii.	Acinetobacter baumannii has become one of the most challenging conditional pathogens in health facilities. It causes various infectious diseases in humans, such as wound or urinary tract infections and pneumonia. Phage therapy has been used as an alternative strategy for antibiotic-resistant A. baumannii infections and has been approved by several governments. Previously, we have reported two potential phage therapy candidates, Abp1 and Abp9, both of which are narrow-host-range phages. In the present study, we screened and isolated 22 A. baumannii bacteriophages from hospital sewage water and determined that Abp95 has a wide host range (29%; 58/200). The biological and genomic characteristics and anti-infection potential of Abp95 were also investigated. Abp95 belongs to the Myoviridae family, with a G+C content of 37.85% and a genome size of 43,176 bp. Its genome encodes 77 putative genes, none of which are virulence, lysogeny, or antibiotic resistance genes. Abp95 was found to accelerate wound healing in a diabetic mouse wound infection model by clearing local infections of multidrug-resistant A. baumannii. In conclusion, the lytic phage Abp95, which has a wide host range, demonstrates potential as a candidate for phage therapy against multiple sequence types of carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii.	2023 Jan	Li Huang, Siyi Huang, Lingli Jiang, Jingjie Tan, Xueping Yan, Chunmei Gou, Xinchong Chen, Lijuan Xiang, Dali Wang, Guangtao Huang, Yixin Zhang, Chengliang Deng	Sci Rep
37107101	Quercetin: Synergistic Interaction with Antibiotics against Colistin-Resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>.	Infections caused by resistant strains of <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> are now a global problem that requires the immediate development of new antimicrobial drugs. Combination therapy is one of the strategies used to solve this problem. Based on this information, the purpose of this study was to determine whether quercetin (QUE), in combination with three antibiotics, is effective against colistin-resistant <i>A. baumannii</i> strains (ColR-Ab). The effects of the combination of QUE with colistin (COL), amikacin (AMK), and meropenem (MEM) were evaluated according to the checkerboard synergy test. The combinations of QUE + COL and QUE + AMK showed synergistic activity on ColR-Ab strains with FICI values in the range of 0.1875-0.5 and 0.1875-0.2825, respectively. A 4- to 16-fold decrease in COL MIC and a 16- to 64-fold decrease in AMK MIC values were detected. Synergistic activity was confirmed by the time-kill test, and these combinations were found to be bactericidal at the end of 24 h. According to spectrophotometric measurements, the combinations of QUE + COL and QUE + AMK induced membrane damage, leading to the leakage of nucleic acids. Cell lysis and cell death were confirmed with SEM observations. The detected synergy offers an opportunity for the future development of treatment strategies for potential infections caused by ColR-Ab strains.	2023 Apr	Elif Odabaş Köse, Özlem Koyuncu Özyurt, Süreyya Bilmen, Hakan Er, Cansu Kilit, Esra Aydemir	Antibiotics (Basel)
35980044	Immune Response to Conjugates of Fragments of the Type K9 Capsular Polysaccharide of Acinetobacter baumannii with Carrier Proteins.	The clonal bacterial species Acinetobacter baumannii is an emerging multidrug-resistant pathogen which causes high-lethality infections. Cells of A. baumannii are surrounded by the type-specific capsular polysaccharide (CPS), which provides resistance to the protective mechanisms of the host and is considered a target for immunization. The conjugates of three inert carrier proteins and A. baumannii type K9 CPS fragments, which contained various numbers of oligosaccharide repeats (K-units), were synthesized by periodate oxidation and squaric acid chemistry. The conjugates were applied to immunize mice, and chemical synthesis by squaric acid was shown to significantly improve the immunogenic properties of glycoconjugate. In BALB/c mice, IgG antibodies were predominant among type K9 CPS reactive antibodies, and their total content was several times higher than that of IgM. Immune sera were characterized by their opsonization ability during practically the entire lives of the experimental mice. The sera were cross-reactive, but the highest specificity was observed against the antigen (type K9 CPS) used for immunization. The immunization of BALB/c and ICR-1 mice with a glycoconjugate without adjuvants led to varying degrees of stimulation of IL-10, IL-17A, and TNF-α production, but not IL-4 production in the ICR-1 mice. This is in contrast to the BALB/c mice, in which γ-IFN production was also activated. The protective effectiveness of the glycoconjugates obtained by squaric acid chemistry was demonstrated by experiments that involved challenging immunized and nonimmunized animals with a lethal dose of A. baumannii K9. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Immunization by glycoconjugates with A. baumannii type K9 CPS fragments induced a high level of antibodies (predominantly IgG) in sera, which reacted specifically with the CPS of A. baumannii type K9, as well as a long immunological memory. The sera of immunized animals efficiently opsonized A. baumannii type K9. Immunization resulted in the balanced production of pro/anti-inflammatory lymphokines and protective antibodies to ensure the survival of the mice infected with A. baumannii. The level of specific antibodies was sufficient to provide protective immunity against the challenge by A. baumannii, making this approach applicable in the development of vaccine preparations.	2022 Oct	Natalia Rudenko, Anna Karatovskaya, Anna Zamyatina, Anna Shepelyakovskaya, Svetlana Semushina, Fedor Brovko, Anna Shpirt, Vladimir Torgov, Natalia Kolotyrkina, Alexandr Zinin, Anastasiya Kasimova, Andrei Perepelov, Mikhail Shneider, Yuriy Knirel	Microbiol Spectr
37093361	Molecular Docking, Anti-Biofilm & Antibacterial Activities and Therapeutic Index of mCM11 Peptide on Acinetobacter baumannii Strains.	Despite the huge efforts of microbiologists, infectious diseases have yet remained one of the leading causes of death in humans, further highlighting the research priority for controlling opportunistic pathogens. Many researchers have used antibacterial peptides to solve the problem of antibiotic resistance. This research is thus conducted to investigate the antibacterial and anti-biofilm activity of a novel modified cecropin-melittin 11-peptide with improved therapeutic properties and lower side effects. After synthesis and purification of mCM11 (NH2-WRLFRRILRVL-NH2) by solid-phase synthesis and HPLC methods, respectively, the antibacterial and biofilm inhibitory activities were explored in vitro. TMHMM was used to confirm the reaction of mCM11 on the plasma membrane of the prokaryotic cells. The interaction between mCM11 on Acinetobacter baumannii strains was investigated by molecular docking using ClusPro2.0. Hemolysis and therapeutic indexes were also calculated to quantify the relative safety and adverse effects of mCM11. According to the results, mCM11 has a high inhibitory and lethal effect on A. baumannii strains due to its cationic properties and new specific sequence. Molecular docking revealed the release of a significant amount of energy when mCM11 binds to the surface of A. baumannii in an appropriate site. The findings indicated that mCM11 IC50 (4 μg/mL) lysed 2.78% of RBCs; moreover, 8 strains of Acinetobacter baumannii showed a favorable therapeutic index. The mCM11 exhibits strong antibacterial and antibiofilm activities against A. baumannii strains, suggesting its potential therapeutic role in infections caused by these strains. Similar to its impact on A. baumannii, mCM11 could be a suitable alternative to antibiotics in combat against antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the in vivo experiments.	2023 Apr	Sajjad Eshtiaghi, Razieh Nazari, Mahdi Fasihi-Ramandi	Curr Microbiol
35420470	C6 Hydroxymethyl-Substituted Carbapenem MA-1-206 Inhibits the Major <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> Carbapenemase OXA-23 by Impeding Deacylation.	Acinetobacter baumannii has become a major nosocomial pathogen, as it is often multidrug-resistant, which results in infections characterized by high mortality rates. The bacterium achieves high levels of resistance to β-lactam antibiotics by producing β-lactamases, enzymes which destroy these valuable agents. Historically, the carbapenem family of β-lactam antibiotics have been the drugs of choice for treating A. baumannii infections. However, their effectiveness has been significantly diminished due to the pathogen's production of carbapenem-hydrolyzing class D β-lactamases (CHDLs); thus, new antibiotics and inhibitors of these enzymes are urgently needed. Here, we describe a new carbapenem antibiotic, MA-1-206, in which the canonical C6 hydroxyethyl group has been replaced with hydroxymethyl. The antimicrobial susceptibility studies presented here demonstrated that this compound is more potent than meropenem and imipenem against A. baumannii producing OXA-23, the most prevalent CHDL of this pathogen, and also against strains producing the CHDL OXA-24/40 and the class B metallo-β-lactamase VIM-2. Our kinetic and mass spectrometry studies revealed that this drug is a reversible inhibitor of OXA-23, where inhibition takes place through a branched pathway. X-ray crystallographic studies, molecular docking, and molecular dynamics simulations of the OXA-23-MA-1-206 complex show that the C6 hydroxymethyl group forms a hydrogen bond with the carboxylated catalytic lysine of OXA-23, effectively preventing deacylation. These results provide a promising strategy for designing a new generation of CHDL-resistant carbapenems to restore their efficacy against deadly A. baumannii infections. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Carbapenem antibiotics are the drugs of choice for treatment of deadly infections caused by Gram-negative bacteria. However, their efficacy is severely compromised by the wide spread of carbapenem-hydrolyzing class D β-lactamases (CHDLs). The importance of this research is the discovery that substitution of the canonical hydroxyethyl group of carbapenems by a hydroxymethyl significantly enhances stability against inactivation by the major CHDL of Acinetobacter baumannii, OXA-23. These results provide a novel strategy for designing next-generation, carbapenemase-stable carbapenems to fight multidrug-resistant infections caused by Gram-negative pathogens.	2022 Jun	Nichole K Stewart, Marta Toth, Maha A Alqurafi, Weirui Chai, Thu Q Nguyen, Pojun Quan, Mijoon Lee, John D Buynak, Clyde A Smith, Sergei B Vakulenko	mBio

35830449	Synergistic activities of colistin combined with other antimicrobial agents against colistin-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii clinical isolates.	Emerging resistance to colistin in Acinetobacter baumannii clinical strains is concerning because of the limited therapeutic choices for these important clinical pathogens. We studied the in vitro activities of different colistin-based antimicrobial agent combinations against colistin-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii. Fourteen clinical isolates of colistin-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii were obtained between 2015 and 2016. To identify colistin-based combinations with synergistic activities, multiple two antimicrobial combinations based on 8 commercially available drugs were evaluated by the checkerboard method. The most effective colistin-based combinations were vancomycin, aztreonam, ceftazidime and imipenem which showed synergistic activities against all examined strains. Colistin-rifampin showed synergy against four strains. Colistin-tigecycline and colistin-amikacin mostly showed indifferent results. By using the checkerboard tests, we were able to find the most promising colistin-based combinations that may provide more therapeutic options against colistin-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii.	2022	Mashal M Almutairi	PLoS One

35862390	Adjuvant antimicrobial activity and resensitization efficacy of geraniol in combination with antibiotics on Acinetobacter baumannii clinical isolates.	Adjuvant use of geraniol, a plant essential oil component, is known to increase the efficacy of antibiotics by acting as a potent inhibitor of efflux mechanisms. In this study, we assessed the effect of a geraniol-antibiotic combination in 21 Acinetobacter baumannii clinical isolates consisting of high efflux (HE) and low efflux (LE) activity groups. We determined the MIC for geraniol and the four antibiotics and evaluated the adjuvant antimicrobial activity and resensitization efficacy of adjuvant geraniol. Geraniol-antibiotic combinations significantly reduced the MIC of all four antibiotics (P < 0.0001), and the fold change in MIC decreased by 4 to >256-fold for tigecycline, >16 to >4,096-fold for ceftazidime, 1 to >4,096-fold for cefepime, and >2 to >4096-fold for ciprofloxacin. Importantly, geraniol showed adjuvant antimicrobial activity and resensitization efficacy when used in combination with antibiotics in 21 A. baumannii clinical isolates. However, there was no statistically significant difference between the HE and LE groups. Low concentrations (0.125% and 0.0625%) of geraniol showed no cytotoxic or hemolytic activity. Our study shows that geraniol, acting as an antibiotic adjuvant, is a good candidate for in vivo studies of combination therapy for the treatment of MDR/XDR A. baumannii infections.	2022	Choon-Mee Kim, Young Jin Ko, Seul-Bi Lee, Sook Jin Jang	PLoS One

36518018	High rates of extensively drug-resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> in a Peruvian hospital 2013-2019.	Multidrug-resistant (MDR) <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> has become a major concern of hospital care. The objective of the study was to evaluate the evolution of antimicrobial resistance of <i>A. baumannii</i> in a Peruvian hospital from 2013 to 2019. A total of 993 <i>A. baumannii</i> clinical isolates were recovered. Antimicrobial resistance levels were extremely high, except for colistin. Among the remaining antibacterial agents, ampicillin plus sulbactam (AMS) was the most active (71.4% of resistance), with resistance levels to the remaining agents ranging from 75.9% to amikacin to 99.2% to ertapenem. The presence of significant differences was observed in extensively drug-resistant (XDR) <i>A. baumannii</i> according to samples origin. No association was observed between MDR or XDR isolates and seasonality. An impressive rate of XDR <i>A. baumannii</i> isolates was found, including a growing number of only-colistin-susceptible isolates highlighting the urgent need for new therapeutic alternatives.	2023 Apr	Rodrigo Samuel Barrientos-Yong, Bryan Andrei Hinojosa-Salas, Percy Genaro Salas-Ponce, Eddie Angles, Joaquim Ruiz, Maria J Pons	Trop Doct

35595766	6-Bromo-2-naphthol from Silene armeria extract sensitizes Acinetobacter baumannii strains to polymyxin.	The overuse of antibiotics has led to the emergence of multidrug-resistant bacteria, which are resistant to various antibiotics. Combination therapies using natural compounds with antibiotics have been found to have synergistic effects against several pathogens. Synergistic natural compounds can potentiate the effects of polymyxins for the treatment of Acinetobacter baumannii infection. Out of 120 types of plant extracts, only Silene armeria extract (SAE) showed a synergistic effect with polymyxin B (PMB) in our fractional inhibitory concentration and time-kill analyses. The survival rate of G. mellonella infected with A. baumannii ATCC 17978 increased following the synergistic treatment. Interestingly, the addition of osmolytes, such as trehalose, canceled the synergistic effect of SAE with PMB; however, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Quadrupole time-of-flight liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry revealed 6-bromo-2-naphthol (6B2N) to be a major active compound that exhibited synergistic effects with PMB. Pretreatment with 6B2N made A. baumannii cells more susceptible to PMB exposure in a time- and concentration-dependent manner, indicating that 6B2N exhibits consequential synergistic action with PMB. Moreover, the exposure of 6B2N-treated cells to PMB led to higher membrane leakage and permeability. The present findings provide a promising approach for utilizing plant extracts as adjuvants to reduce the toxicity of PMB in A. baumannii infection.	2022 May	Mingyeong Kang, Wonjae Kim, Jaebok Lee, Hye Su Jung, Che Ok Jeon, Woojun Park	Sci Rep
35783393	Genomic Characterization of Mobile Genetic Elements Associated With Carbapenem Resistance of <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> From India.	With the excessive genome plasticity, <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> can acquire and disseminate antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes often associated with mobile genetic elements (MGEs). Analyzing the genetic environment of resistance genes often provides valuable information on the origin, emergence, evolution, and spread of resistance. Thus, we characterized the genomic features of some clinical isolates of carbapenem-resistant <i>A. baumannii</i> (CRAb) to understand the role of diverse MGEs and their genetic context responsible for disseminating carbapenem resistance genes. For this, 17 clinical isolates of <i>A. baumannii</i> obtained from multiple hospitals in India between 2018 and 2019 were analyzed. AMR determinants, the genetic context of resistance genes, and molecular epidemiology were studied using whole-genome sequencing. This study observed an increased prevalence of <i>bla</i> <sub><i>OXA-23</i></sub> followed by dual carbapenemases, <i>bla</i> <sub><i>OXA-23</i></sub> , and <i>bla</i> <sub><i>NDM</i></sub> . This study identified three novel Oxford MLST sequence types. The majority of the isolates belonged to the dominant clone, IC2, followed by less prevalent clones such as IC7 and IC8. This study identified variations of AbaR4 and AbGRI belonging to the IC2 lineage. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that provides comprehensive profiling of resistance islands, their related MGEs, acquired AMR genes, and the distribution of clonal lineages of CRAb from India.	2022	Saranya Vijayakumar, Jobin John Jacob, Karthick Vasudevan, Purva Mathur, Pallab Ray, Ayyanraj Neeravi, Ashtawarthani Baskaran, Agilandeeswari Kirubananthan, Shalini Anandan, Indranil Biswas, Kamini Walia, Balaji Veeraraghavan	Front Microbiol

36005804	<i>In Vitro</i> Activity of Sulbactam-Durlobactam against Global Isolates of <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>-<i>calcoaceticus</i> Complex Collected from 2016 to 2021.	Sulbactam-durlobactam is a β-lactam-β-lactamase inhibitor combination designed to treat serious Acinetobacter baumannii<i>-calcoaceticus</i> complex (ABC) infections, including carbapenem-non-susceptible and multidrug-resistant (MDR) isolates. The current study characterized the <i>in vitro</i> activity of sulbactam-durlobactam against a collection of 5,032 ABC clinical isolates collected in 33 countries across the Asia/South Pacific region, Europe, Latin America, the Middle East, and North America from 2016 to 2021. The sulbactam-durlobactam MIC<sub>50</sub> and MIC<sub>90</sub> were 1 and 2 μg/mL, respectively, for all ABC isolates tested. The addition of durlobactam (at a fixed concentration of 4 μg/mL) to sulbactam decreased its MIC<sub>50</sub> by 8-fold (from 8 to 1 μg/mL) and its MIC<sub>90</sub> by 32-fold (from 64 to 2 μg/mL) for all ABC isolates. The <i>in vitro</i> activity of sulbactam-durlobactam was maintained across individual ABC species, years, global regions of collection, specimen sources, and resistance phenotypes, including MDR and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) isolates. At 4 μg/mL (preliminary sulbactam-durlobactam susceptible MIC breakpoint), sulbactam-durlobactam inhibited 98.3% of all ABC isolates and >96% of sulbactam-, imipenem-, ciprofloxacin-, amikacin-, and minocycline-non-susceptible isolates; as well as colistin-resistant, MDR, and XDR isolates. Most imipenem-non-susceptible ABC isolates (96.8%, 2,488/2,570) were carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii (CRAB); 96.9% (2,410/2,488) of CRAB isolates were sulbactam-durlobactam-susceptible. More than 80% of ABC isolates had sulbactam-durlobactam MIC values that were ≥2 doubling-dilutions (4-fold) lower than sulbactam alone. Only 1.7% (84/5,032) of ABC isolates from 2016 to 2021 had sulbactam-durlobactam MIC values of >4 μg/mL. Of the 84 isolates, 94.0% were A. baumannii, 4.8% were A. pittii, and 1.2% were A. nosocomialis. In summary, sulbactam-durlobactam demonstrated potent antibacterial activity against a 2016 to 2021 collection of geographically diverse clinical isolates of ABC isolates, including carbapenem-non-susceptible and MDR isolates.	2022 Sep	James A Karlowsky, Meredith A Hackel, Sarah M McLeod, Alita A Miller	Antimicrob Agents Chemother
36195749	Antibiotic resistance and carriage class I integron in clinical isolates of Acinetobacter baumannii from Al Muthanna, Iraq.	The goal of this work was to systematically characterize and detect class 1, 2, and 3 integrons with many antibiotic resistance A. baumannii strains collected from a clinical environment in Iraq's Al-Muthanna hospitals. In this investigation, 24 non-replicated clinical strains of A. baumannii were evaluated using Chrome agar as a selective medium and PCR of the rplB gene. The clonal relatedness of the isolates to class 1 integron was evaluated using a PCR technique. The prevalence of class 1 integron was detected by PCR in only 12 clones of A. baumannii followed by HinfI digestion analysis showing three identical bands at 160 bp, 1350 bp, and 870 bp. In addition, PCR sequencing confirmed the presence of gene cassette arrays consisting of aacA4-catB8-aadA1 (100%) in class 1 integron. The sequence analysis of the integron shows 97.87 identity with A. baumannii isolates from Australia (GenBank accession number CP054302) among A. baumannii isolates. The blast analysis of this class I integron showed that the presence of the intI1, aacA4-catB8-aadA1 genes can considerably boost the acquisition of MDR phenotypes in A. baumannii isolates. We concluded that antibiotics of many types are widely used. The presence of integrons in A. baumannii is concerning for public health. In the clinical setting, it appears that the class 1 integron can be used as a predictive biomarker for the presence of MDR phenotypes. In these bacteria, however, the integron does not possess carbapenemases genes.	2022 Dec	Yasir Adil Jabbar Alabdali	J Antibiot (Tokyo)
36045685	Hybrid antigens expressing surface loops of BauA from <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> are capable of inducing protection against infection.	<i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> is a human bacterial pathogen of increasing concern in clinical settings due to the emergence of antibiotic resistant strains and the lack of effective therapeutics. Researchers have been exploring new treatment options such as novel drug candidates and vaccines to prevent severe infections and mortality. Bacterial surface antigens that are essential to <i>A. baumannii</i> for acquiring micronutrients (e.g. iron, zinc) from nutrient restricted environments are being considered as targets for vaccines or immunotherapy due to their crucial role for growth and pathogenesis in the human host. BauA, the outer membrane receptor for the siderophore acinetobactin was targeted for vaccine development in this study. Due to challenges in the commercial production of membrane proteins for vaccines, a novel hybrid antigen method developed by our group was used. Exposed loops of BauA were selected and displayed on a foreign scaffold to generate novel hybrid antigens designed to elicit an immune response against the native BauA protein. The potential epitopes were incorporated into a scaffold derived from the C-lobe of <i>Neisseria meningitidis</i> transferrin binding protein B (TbpB), named the loopless C-lobe (LCL). Hybrid proteins displaying three selected loops (5, 7 and 8) individually or in combination were designed and produced and evaluated in an <i>A. baumannii</i> murine sepsis model as vaccine antigens. Immunization with the recombinant BauA protein protected 100% of the mice while immunization with hybrid antigens displaying individual loops achieved between 50 and 100% protection. The LCL scaffold did not induce a protective immune response, enabling us to attribute the observed protection elicited by the hybrid antigens to the displayed loops. Notably, the mice immunized with the hybrid antigen displaying loop 7 were completely protected from infection. Taken together, these results suggest that our hybrid antigen approach is a viable method for generating novel vaccine antigens that target membrane surface proteins necessary for bacterial growth and pathogenesis and the loop 7 hybrid antigen can be a foundation for approaches to combat <i>A. baumannii</i> infections.	2022	Somshukla Chaudhuri, Iraj Rasooli, Ramin Hatefi Oskouei, Mahdi Pishgahi, Abolfazl Jahangir, Vahid Farshchi Andisi, Anthony B Schryvers	Front Immunol
36909706	Computational exploration of molecular flexibility and interaction of meropenem analogs with the active site of oxacillinase-23 in <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>.	<b>Background:</b> Carbapenem-resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> is an opportunistic pathogen responsible for nosocomial infections and is one of the biggest global threats according to the World Health Organization (WHO), particularly causing substantial morbidity and mortality. <b>Objectives:</b> This study aimed at using computational approaches to screen meropenem and its analogs against OXA-23-positive <i>Acinetobacter baumannii,</i> analyzing the correlations between kinetic and phenotypic characteristics. <b>Methods:</b> A total of 5,450 compounds were screened using virtual screening workflow (HTVS, Glide-SP, and Glide-XP) to identify the best compounds based on their binding energy and interactions against OXA-23 and OXA-27 as they had phenotypic data available. Molecular dynamics simulation and density functional theory (DFT) studies were performed from the outcome of molecular docking analysis. <b>Results:</b> During simulations, meropenem and its analogs exhibited high-level stable interactions with Ser79, Ser126, Thr217, Trp219, and Arg259 of OXA-23. Meropenem displayed a CovDock energy of about -3.5 and -1.9 kcal mol<sup>-1</sup> against OXA-23 and OXA-27, respectively. Among the 5,450 compounds, Pubchem_10645796, Pubchem_25224737, and ChEMBL_14 recorded CovDock energy between -6.0 and -9.0 kcal mol<sup>-1</sup>. Moreover, the infra-red (IR) spectrophotometric analysis revealed C=O and C-N atoms showing bands at 1,800 and 1,125 cm<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. These observed data are in congruence with the experimental observations. <b>Conclusion:</b> The identified compounds showed good agreement with the spectrophotometric analysis using DFT methods. In the earlier studies, meropenem's MIC value was 32 μg mL<sup>-1</sup> in OXA-23-positive isolate A2265 compared to the MIC of 1 μg mL<sup>-1</sup> in Δ<i>bla</i> <sub>OXA-23</sub> A2265. Comparing the CovDock energy and hydrogen-bonding interactions, the predicted results are in good agreement with the experimental data reported earlier. Our results highlight the importance of OXA-23 molecular docking studies and their compliance with the phenotypic results. It will help further in developing newer antibiotics for treating severe infections associated with carbapenem-resistant <i>A. baumannii</i>.	2023	Balajee Ramachandran, Saravanan Muthupandian, Jeyakanthan Jeyaraman, Bruno Silvester Lopes	Front Chem
36946729	Development of Modernized Acinetobacter baumannii Susceptibility Test Interpretive Criteria for Recommended Antimicrobial Agents Using Pharmacometric Approaches.	Acinetobacter baumannii-Acinetobacter calcoaceticus complex (referred to herein as A. baumannii) treatment guidelines contain numerous older antimicrobial agents with susceptibility test interpretive criteria (STIC, also known as susceptibility breakpoints) set using only epidemiological data. We utilized a combination of <i>in vitro</i> surveillance data, preclinical murine thigh and lung infection models, population pharmacokinetics, simulation, and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) target attainment analyses to evaluate A. baumannii STIC for four commonly recommended antimicrobials from different classes (amikacin, ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, and minocycline). Antimicrobial <i>in vitro</i> surveillance data were based on 1,647 clinical A. baumannii isolates obtained from 109 centers in the United States and Europe. Among these isolates, 5 were selected for evaluation in murine infection models based on fitness and MIC variability. PK and dose-ranging studies were conducted using neutropenic murine thigh and lung infection models The MIC ranges for the 5 isolates evaluated were as follows: amikacin, 2 to 32 μg/mL; ceftazidime, 4 to 16 μg/mL; ciprofloxacin, 0.12 to 2 μg/mL; minocycline, 0.25 to 4 μg/mL. All organisms grew ≥1.5 log<sub>10</sub> CFU in both models in untreated controls. Plasma and epithelial lining fluid (ELF) pharmacokinetics for all drugs were determined in mice using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) methods. For each isolate, 5 dose levels of each drug were tested individually in the thigh and lung infection model. The inoculum ranged from 7.9 to 8.4 and 6.8 to 7.7 log<sub>10</sub> CFU/mL for the lung and thigh models, respectively. PK/PD targets associated with net bacterial stasis and 1- and 2-log<sub>10</sub> CFU reductions from baseline were identified for each organism/infection model using Hill-type models. Population pharmacokinetic models for each agent were identified from the literature. Using demographic variables for simulated patients with hospital-acquired or ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia or urinary tract infections (including acute pyelonephritis) who were administered maximal dosing regimens of each agent, estimates of protein binding, and ELF penetration ratios based on data from the literature, free-drug plasma and total-drug concentration-time profiles were generated, and PK/PD indices by MIC were calculated. Percent probabilities of attaining median and randomly assigned PK/PD targets associated with the above-described endpoints were determined. Recommended susceptible breakpoints for each agent were those representing the highest MIC at which the percent probabilities of achieving PK/PD targets associated with a 1-log<sub>10</sub> CFU reduction from baseline approached or were ≥90%. The following susceptible breakpoints for A. baumannii were identified: amikacin, ≤8 μg/mL for pneumonia; ceftazidime, ≤32 and ≤8 μg/mL for pneumonia; ciprofloxacin, ≤1 μg/mL; and minocycline, ≤0.5/≤1 μg/mL which correspond to the standard and high minocycline dosing regimens of 200 mg per day and 200 mg every 12 h, respectively. Implementation of appropriate STIC will help clinicians optimally use the above-described agents and improve the likelihood of successful patient outcomes.	2023 Apr	A J Lepak, M Trang, J P Hammel, H S Sader, S M Bhavnani, B D VanScoy, J M Pogue, P G Ambrose, D R Andes, United States Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing	Antimicrob Agents Chemother

33393388	Evaluation of the Significance of Constant Laser Therapy, 532 nm, in Various Exposure Times on the Healing Process of Wounds Infected by <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>.	Many considerable investigations focused on the stimulation of therapeutic manners of infected injuries in mice. The exaggerated pathogens that induced wounds were gram-positive like staphylococcal and gram-negative, for example, <i>Pseudomonas aeuroginosa</i> and <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>. <i>Acinetobacter</i> can generate a scale range of an infection that may be received in a hospital or any wellness concern facility. In order to know the significance of laser 532 nm with a constant irradiance at various exposure times on the healing process of wounds infected by <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>, this study was performed on the BALB/C mice. An elliptical full-thickness skin injury was made on the backside of 45 adult female (BALB/C) mice. Injuries were affected via <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> and were randomly assigned into 3 groups. Semiconductor diode continuous wave laser, λ = 532 nm, with output power 40 mW was used. The power density was 5.71 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>, while the fluencies were 1.7 J/cm<sup>2</sup> and 5.14 J/cm<sup>2</sup>. Fifteen mice were classified according to the times of irradiation. The first group was infected and presented as control, without irradiation. The second group was infected and irradiated for 5 minutes. The third group, likewise, was infected but irradiated for 15 minutes. All groups were subdivided according to the following period, 3, 5, and 10 days, after irradiation and the animals were killed after the treatment. Wound healing was made by measuring the rate of wound closure and histopathological evaluation. The study determined that 532 nm laser therapy had an obvious and positive influence on the healing of infected wounds with fluence (5.14 J/cm<sup>2</sup>).	2022 Dec	Zahra Al-Timimi	Int J Low Extrem Wounds

36778331	Replicative <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> strains interfere with phagosomal maturation by modulating the vacuolar pH.	Bacterial pneumonia is a common infection of the lower respiratory tract that can afflict patients of all ages. Multidrug-resistant strains of <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> are increasingly responsible for causing nosocomial pneumonias, thus posing an urgent threat. Alveolar macrophages play a critical role in overcoming respiratory infections caused by this pathogen. Recently, we and others have shown that new clinical isolates of <i>A. baumannii</i> , but not the common lab strain ATCC 19606 (19606), can persist and replicate in macrophages within spacious vacuoles that we called <i>A cinetobacter</i> C ontaining V acuoles (ACV). In this work, we demonstrate that the modern <i>A. baumannii</i> clinical isolate 398, but not the lab strain 19606, can infect alveolar macrophages and produce ACVs <i>in vivo</i> in a murine pneumonia model. Both strains initially interact with the alveolar macrophage endocytic pathway, as indicated by EEA1 and LAMP1 markers; however, the fate of these strains diverges at a later stage. While 19606 is eliminated in an autophagy pathway, 398 replicates in ACVs and are not degraded. We show that 398 reverts the natural acidification of the phagosome by secreting large amounts of ammonia, a by-product of amino acid catabolism. We propose that this ability to survive within macrophages may be critical for the persistence of clinical <i>A. baumannii</i> isolates in the lung during a respiratory infection.	2023 Feb	Jesus S Distel, Gisela Di Venanzio, Joseph J Mackel, David A Rosen, Mario F Feldman	bioRxiv
36634346	Discovery and Hit-to-Lead Optimization of Benzothiazole Scaffold-Based DNA Gyrase Inhibitors with Potent Activity against <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> and <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>.	We have developed compounds with a promising activity against <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> and <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>, which are both on the WHO priority list of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Starting from DNA gyrase inhibitor <b>1</b>, we identified compound <b>27</b>, featuring a 10-fold improved aqueous solubility, a 10-fold improved inhibition of topoisomerase IV from <i>A. baumannii</i> and <i>P. aeruginosa</i>, a 10-fold decreased inhibition of human topoisomerase IIα, and no cross-resistance to novobiocin. Cocrystal structures of <b>1</b> in complex with <i>Escherichia coli</i> GyrB24 and (<i>S</i>)-<b>27</b> in complex with <i>A. baumannii</i> GyrB23 and <i>P. aeruginosa</i> GyrB24 revealed their binding to the ATP-binding pocket of the GyrB subunit. In further optimization steps, solubility, plasma free fraction, and other ADME properties of <b>27</b> were improved by fine-tuning of lipophilicity. In particular, analogs of <b>27</b> with retained anti-Gram-negative activity and improved plasma free fraction were identified.

35841965	Potentiate the activity of current antibiotics by naringin dihydrochalcone targeting the AdeABC efflux pump of multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii.	Acinetobacter baumannii is an ESKAPE pathogen responsible for severe nosocomial infections. Among all the mechanisms contributing to multidrug resistance, efflux pumps have gained significant attention due to their widespread distribution among bacterial species and broad substrate specificity. This study has investigated the diverse roles of efflux pumps present in carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii (CRAB) and screen an efflux pump inhibitor. The result showed the presence of AdeABC, AdeFGH, AdeIJK, and AbeM efflux pumps in CRAB, and experimental studies using gene mutants demonstrated the significant role of AdeABC in carbapenem resistance, biofilm formation, surface motility, pathogenesis, bacterial adherence, and invasion to the host cells. The structure-based ligand screening, molecular mechanics, molecular dynamics simulation, and experimental validation using efflux pump mutants and antibiotic accumulation assay identified naringin dihydrochalcone (NDC) as the lead against AdeB. This lead was selected as a capping agent for silver nanoparticles. The NDC-capped silver nanoparticles (NDC-AgNPs) were characterized by UV-spectroscopy, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), dynamic light scattering (DLS), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The investigated molecular mechanism showed that the NDC-AgNPs possessed multiple mechanisms of action. In addition to efflux inhibitory activity, it also generates reactive oxygen and nitrogen species as well as causes change in the electrochemical gradient in CRAB. The proton gradient is important for the function of AdeABC; hence altering the electrochemical gradient also disrupts its efflux activity. Moreover, A. baumannii did not develop any resistance against NDC-AgNPs till several generations which were investigated. The NDC-AgNPs were also found to be effective against carbapenem-resistant clinical isolates of A. baumannii. Therefore, the present study provided an insight into the efflux pump mediated carbapenem resistance and possible inhibitor NDC-AgNPs to combat AdeABC efflux pump mediated resistance.	2022 Sep	Privita Verma, Monalisa Tiwari, Vishvanath Tiwari	Int J Biol Macromol
36858184	Molecular docking and dynamic approach to screen the drug candidate against the Imipenem-resistant CarO porin in Acinetobacter baumannii.	The multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii is an emerging nosocomial pathogen in the healthcare sector. Intrinsic resistance in A. baumannii is a significant problem framing a perfect treatment regimen. Also, this organism showed more resistance towards the carbapenem antibiotics, especially for imipenem and meropenem. The development of carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii is mainly due to the alteration or loss of the porin region in the outer membrane. The most well-known porin in Acinetobacter baumannii is CarO (carbapenem-associated outer membrane protein). The CarO protein, which functions as a porin channel for carbapenem inflow, may contribute to carbapenem resistance. The current study identifies a potent drug candidate with a better binding affinity to the carbapenem-resistant outer membrane protein. We investigated the specificity of carbapenems such as imipenem, meropenem, ertapenem, biapenem, doripenem, and fluoroquinolone drugs such as sitafloxacin against the imipenem-resistant CarO protein was demonstrated using the computational approaches molecular docking and dynamic simulation for 50 ns. As a result, the high to low enzyme-ligand complex's binding affinity exhibited a greater binding affinity for ertapenem -7.76 kcal·mol<sup>-1</sup> and sitafloxacin -7.75 kcal·mol<sup>-1</sup> than biapenem, doripenem, meropenem, and imipenem. The molecular dynamic simulation and the MMPBSA analysis depicted ertapenem -55.431±25.908 kJ/mol and sitafloxacin -47.154 ± 11.052 kJ/mol with better binding affinity and more stability against the imipenem resistant CarO protein when it compared to other antibiotics.	2023 Apr	Mohanraj Gopikrishnan, C George Priya Doss	Microb Pathog
36174234	Synergy of a virulent phage (φAB182) with antibiotics leading to successful elimination of biofilms formed by MDR <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>.	Emergence of multiple drug resistant (MDR) strains of <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> and a withering drug discovery pipeline necessitates the search for effective alternatives to replace or synergize with currently used antibiotics. In this report, we have described the synergy assessment of a virulent <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> phage φAB182 with a wide range of antibiotics. Myophage φAB182 was isolated from sewage against MDR <i>A. baumannii</i> and exhibited maximum stability at 25 °C and pH 7. It also had a short latent period of 9 min with a large burst size of 287. The phylogenetic analysis of its major capsid protein gene indicated an 84.15% similarity to the lytic <i>A. baumannii</i> phage Acj9. In the presence of antibiotics, phage φAB182 showed the highest synergy (<i>p</i> < 0.0001) with colistin, followed by polymixin B, ceftazidime and cefotaxime and this synergistic effect was further validated by time kill kinetics. The combined action of phage φAB182 with colistin, polymixin B, ceftazidime and cefotaxime was also synergistic for the eradication of biofilms formed by <i>A. baumannii</i> as measured by MBEC<sub>combination</sub>/MBEC<sub>antibiotic</sub> values (<0.25). We thus propose bacteriophage φAB182 as a potential antibacterial candidate in combination therapy. The findings from this study strongly support the use of phage antibiotic synergy for the successful treatment of biofilm forming MDR <i>A. baumannii</i> infections.	2022 Dec	Medhavi Vashisth, Shikha Yashveer, Anu Bala Jaglan, Nitin Virmani, Bidhan Chand Bera, Rajesh Kumar Vaid, Taruna Anand	Can J Microbiol
35475638	Involvement of a Phage-Encoded Wzy Protein in the Polymerization of K127 Units To Form the Capsular Polysaccharide of Acinetobacter baumannii Isolate 36-1454.	A comprehensive understanding of capsular polysaccharide (CPS) diversity is critical to implementation of phage therapy to treat panresistant Acinetobacter baumannii infections. Predictions from genome sequences can assist identification of the CPS type but can be complicated if genes outside the K locus (CPS biosynthesis gene cluster) are involved. Here, the CPS produced by A. baumannii clinical isolate 36-1454 carrying a novel K locus, KL127, was determined and compared to other CPSs. KL127 differs from KL128 in only two of the glycosyltransferase (<i>gtr</i>) genes. The K127 unit in 36-1454 CPS was the pentasaccharide β-d-Glc<i>p</i>-(1→6)-d-β-Gal<i>p</i>NAc-(1→6)-α-d-Gal<i>p</i>-(1→6)-β-d-Glс<i>p</i>-(1→3)-β-d-Gal<i>p</i>NAc in which d-Glc<i>p</i> at position 4 replaces d-Gal<i>p</i> in K128, and the glycosyltransferases encoded by the different <i>gtr</i> genes form the surrounding linkages. However, although the KL127 and KL128 gene clusters encode nearly identical Wzy polymerases, the linkages between K units that form the CPS chains are different, i.e., β-d-Gal<i>p</i>NAc-(1→3)-d-Gal<i>p</i> in 36-1454 (K127) and β-<i>d-</i>Gal<i>p</i>NAc-(1→4)-d-Gal<i>p</i> in KZ-1093 (K128). The linkage between K127 units in 36-1454 is the same as the K-unit linkage in five known CPS structures, and a gene encoding a Wzy protein related to the Wzy of the corresponding K loci was found encoded in a prophage genome in the 36-1454 chromosome. Closely related Wzy proteins were encoded in unrelated phage in available KL127-carrying genomes. However, a clinical isolate, KZ-1257, carrying KL127 but not the prophage was found, and K127 units in the KZ-1257 CPS were β-d-Gal<i>p</i>NAc-(1→4)-d-Gal<i>p</i> linked, confirming that Wzy<sub>KL127</sub> forms this linkage and thus that the phage-encoded Wzy<sub>Ph1</sub> forms the β-d-Gal<i>p</i>NAc-(1→3)-d-Gal<i>p</i> linkage in 36-1454. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Bacteriophage therapy is an attractive innovative treatment for infections caused by extensively drug resistant Acinetobacter baumannii, for which there are few effective antibiotic treatments remaining. Capsular polysaccharide (CPS) is a primary receptor for many lytic bacteriophages, and thus knowledge of the chemical structures of CPS produced by the species will underpin the identification of suitable phages for therapeutic cocktails. However, recent research has shown that some isolates carry additional genes outside of the CPS biosynthesis K locus, which can modify the CPS structure. These changes can subsequently alter phage receptor sites and may be a method utilized for natural phage resistance. Hence, it is critical to understand the genetics that drive CPS synthesis and the extent to which genes outside of the K locus can affect the CPS structure.	2022 Jun	Nikolay P Arbatsky, Anastasiya A Kasimova, Alexander S Shashkov, Mikhail M Shneider, Anastasiya V Popova, Dmitry A Shagin, Andrey A Shelenkov, Yuliya V Mikhailova, Yurii G Yanushevich, Ruth M Hall, Yuriy A Knirel, Johanna J Kenyon	Microbiol Spectr
36920795	The Impact of Antimicrobial Peptides on the <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> Inner Membrane Is Modulated by Lipid Polyunsaturation.	The Gram-negative pathogen <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> is a primary contributor to nosocomial multi-drug-resistant (MDR) infections. To combat the rise of MDR infections, novel features of <i>A. baumannii</i> need to be considered for the development of new treatment options. One such feature is the preferential scavenging of exogenous lipids, including host-derived polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), for membrane phospholipid synthesis. These alterations in membrane composition impact both the lipid chemistry and the membrane biophysical properties. In this work we examine how antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) interact with the inner membranes of <i>A. baumannii</i> in the presence and absence of polyunsaturated phospholipids. Using coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations of complex <i>A. baumannii</i> inner membrane models derived from lipidomes of bacteria grown in the presence and absence of PUFAs, we examine the impact of the adsorption of four prototypical AMPs (CAMEL, LL-37, pexiganan, and magainin-2) on the membrane biophysical properties. Our simulations reveal that the impact of AMP adsorption on the membrane biophysical properties was dependent on both the membrane composition and the specific AMP involved. Both lipid headgroup charge and tail unsaturation played important roles in driving the interactions that occurred both within the membrane and between the membrane and AMPs. The changes to the membrane biophysical properties also showed a complex relationship with the AMP's physical properties, such as AMP charge, chain length, and charge-to-mass ratio. Cumulatively, this work highlights the importance of studying AMPs using a complex membrane environment and provides insights into the mechanistic action of AMPs in polyunsaturated lipid-rich bacterial membranes.	2023 Apr	Hugo I MacDermott-Opeskin, Katie A Wilson, Megan L O'Mara	ACS Infect Dis
37034553	Targeting Shikimate Kinase Pathway of <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>: A Structure-Based Computational Approach to Identify Antibacterial Compounds.	<i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> (<i>A. baumannii</i>) is an opportunistic bacterium that has developed multidrug resistance (MDR) to most of today's antibiotics, posing a significant risk to human health. Considering the fact that developing novel drugs is a time-consuming and expensive procedure, this research focuses on utilizing computational resources for repurposing antibacterial agents for <i>A. baumannii</i>. We targeted shikimate kinase, an essential enzyme in <i>A. baumannii</i>, that plays a significant role in the metabolic process. The basis for generating new therapeutic compounds is to inhibit the shikimate kinase and thereby targeting the shikimate pathway. Herein, 1941 drug-like compounds were investigated in different <i>in silico</i> techniques for assessing drug-likeness properties, ADMET (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity) profiling, binding affinity, and conformation analysis utilizing Autodock-vina and SwissDock. CHEMBL1237, CHEMBL1237119, CHEMBL2018096, and CHEMBL39167178 were determined as potential drug candidates for suppressing shikimate kinase protein. Molecular Dynamics Simulation (MDS) results for root mean square deviation, root mean square fluctuation, hydrogen bond, and gyration radius confirm the drug candidates' molecular stability with the target protein. According to this study, CHEMBL1237 (Lisinopril) could be the most suitable candidate for <i>A. baumannii</i>. Our investigation suggests that the inhibitors of shikimate kinase could represent promising treatment options for <i>A. baumannii</i>. However, further <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> studies are necessary to validate the therapeutic potential of the suggested drug candidates.	2023	Aparna Shil, Most Afrin Akter, Arafin Sultana, Sajal Kumar Halder, Mahbubul Kabir Himel	J Trop Med

37196408	A SERS bioassay based on vancomycin-modified PEI-interlayered nanocomposite and aptamer-functionalized SERS tags for synchronous detection of Acinetobacter baumannii and Klebsiella pneumoniae.	Klebsiella pneumoniae (KP) and Acinetobacter baumannii (AB) are two important gram-negative bacteria that cause pneumonia and have been recently known to be associated with food. The rapid detection of these pathogens in food is important to minimize their colonization of the gut and stop new threats of the disease from spreading across the food chain. Herein, a double-edged sword aptasensor was developed for the synchronous detection of KP and AB in food and clinical samples. A highly sensitive, selective, specific, and synchronous detection of the target bacteria was achieved, and the limit of detection (LOD) was 10 cells/mL with a liner range of 50 to 10<sup>5</sup> cells/mL. The total assay time was 1.5 h. This study does not only provide a new tool for the detection of the target bacteria, but also serves as a promising tool for food safety and pneumonia diagnosis.	2023 May	Clement Yaw Effah, Lihua Ding, Longlong Tan, Sitian He, Xiang Li, Huijie Yuan, Yi Li, Shaohua Liu, Tongwen Sun, Yongjun Wu	Food Chem

36796791	Evaluation of loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay for visual detection of Acinetobacter baumannii directly from soil and water sample from Mangalore.	Acinetobacter baumannii is a well-known nosocomial pathogen that commonly inhabits soil and water and has been implicated in numerous hospital-acquired infections. The existing methods for detecting A. baumannii have several drawbacks, such as being time-consuming, expensive, labor-intensive, and unable to distinguish between closely related Acinetobacter species. Thus, it is important to have a simple, rapid, sensitive, and specific method for its detection. In this study, we developed a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay using hydroxynaphthol blue dye to visualize A. baumannii by targeting its pgaD gene. The LAMP assay was performed using a simple dry bath and was shown to be specific and highly sensitive, as it could detect up to 10 pg/μl of A. baumannii DNA. Further, the optimized assay was used to detect A. baumannii in soil and water samples by culture-medium enrichment. Out of 27 samples tested, 14 (51.85%) samples were positive for A. baumannii through LAMP assay, while only 5 (18.51%) samples were found to be positive through conventional methods. Thus, the LAMP assay has been found to be a simple, rapid, sensitive, and specific method that can be used as a point-of-care diagnostic tool for detecting A. baumannii.	2023 Mar	Srajana Nayak, Nia Do Carmo Lobo, Karanth Padyana Anupama, Ashwath Nayak, Sadanand Dangari Akshay, Biswajit Maiti	Lett Appl Microbiol

Unlike the historically well-known bacterial transpeptidases, the penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), LDTs are resistant to inhibition by the majority of β-lactam antibiotics, with the exception of carbapenems and penems, allowing bacteria to survive in the presence of these drugs. Here we report characterization of Ldt<sub>Ab</sub> from the clinically important pathogen, <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>. We show that <i>A. baumannii</i> survives inactivation of Ldt<sub>Ab</sub> alone or in combination with PBP1b or PBP2, while simultaneous inactivation of Ldt<sub>Ab</sub> and PBP1a is lethal. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of all 13 β-lactam antibiotics tested decreased 2- to 8-fold for the Ldt<sub>Ab</sub> deletion mutant, while further decreases were seen for both double mutants, with the largest, synergistic effect observed for the Ldt<sub>Ab</sub> + PBP2 deletion mutant. Mass spectrometry experiments showed that Ldt<sub>Ab</sub> forms complexes in vitro only with carbapenems. However, the acylation rate of these antibiotics is very slow, with the reaction taking longer than four hours to complete. Our X-ray crystallographic studies revealed that Ldt<sub>Ab</sub> has a unique structural architecture and is the only known LDT to have two different peptidoglycan-binding domains.	2022 Sep	Marta Toth, Nichole K Stewart, Clyde A Smith, Mijoon Lee, Sergei B Vakulenko	ACS Infect Dis
36306681	Analysis of virulence proteins in pathogenic Acinetobacter baumannii to provide early warning of zoonotic risk.	Acinetobacter baumannii is a ubiquitous opportunistic pathogen usually with low virulence. In recent years, reports of increased pathogenicity of A. baumannii in livestock due to the migratory behaviour of wildlife have attracted public health attention. Our previous study reported that an A. baumannii strain isolated from dead chicks, CCGGD201101, showed enhanced pathogenicity, but the mechanism for increased virulence is not understood. Here, to screen potential virulence factors, the proteomes of the isolated strain CCGGD201101 and the standard strain ATCC19606 of A. baumannii were compared, and the possible virulence-enhancing mechanisms were further analysed. The 50 % lethal dose (LD<sub>50</sub>) values of CCGGD201101 and standard strain ATCC19606 in ICR mice were determined to verify their bacterial toxicity. 2D fluorescence difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) combined with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF/TOF-MS) and quantitative real-time PCR (RTqPCR) were applied to screen and identify differentially expressed proteins or genes that may be related to virulence enhancement. Bioinformatics analyses based on proteinprotein interaction (PPI) networks were used to explore the function of potential virulence proteins. The pathogenicity of potential virulence factors was assessed by phylogenetic analyses and an animal infection model. The results showed that the LD<sub>50</sub> of CCGGD201101 for mice was 1.186 × 10<sup>6</sup> CFU/mL, and the virulence was increased by 180.5-fold compared to ATCC19606. Forty-seven protein spots were significantly upregulated for the A. baumannii CCGGD201101 strain (fold change ≥1.5, p < 0.05). In total, 14 upregulated proteins were identified using proteomic analysis, and the mRNA expression levels of these proteins were nearly identical, with few exceptions. According to the PPI network and phylogenetic analyses, the I78 family peptidase inhibitor, 3-oxoacyl-ACP reductase FabG, and glycine zipper were screened as being closely related to the pathogenicity of bacteria. Furthermore, the I78 overexpression strains exhibited higher lethality in mouse infection models, which indicated that the I78 family peptidase inhibitor was a potential new virulence factor to enhance the pathogenicity of the A. baumannii CCGGD201101 strain. The present study helped us to better understand the mechanisms of virulence enhancement and provided a scientific basis for establishing an early warning system for enhanced virulence of A. baumannii from animals.	2023 Jan	Deying Zou, Jiang Chang, Shiying Lu, Jianfeng Xu, Pan Hu, Kai Zhang, Xiaoli Sun, Wei Guo, Yansong Li, Zengshan Liu, Honglin Ren	Microbiol Res
35780348	Molecular Detection of MBL Encoding Genes in Acinetobacter baumannii strains Isolated from Various Samples at a Tertiary Care Hospital in Mymensingh.	MBL producing Acinetobacter baumannii is a major threat for therapeutic treatment of hospital acquired infections. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of metallo-β-lactamase genes VIM, IMP & SIM genes amongst isolated A. baumannii. This cross sectional study conducted in the department of Microbiology Mymensingh Medical College from March 2019 to February 2020. 49 Acinetobacter spp. were isolated from different clinical samples including endotracheal aspirates, wound swab/pus, urine and blood. Among 380 clinical samples 130 organisms were isolated growth was 34.21%. Out of 130 isolated strains, 49(37.69%) were Acinetobacter spp identified by standard bacteriological method and resistance to different antibiotics was assessed with Kirby- Bauer Disc diffusion method. Among 49 Acinetobacter spp, 39(79.59%) were Acinetobacter baumannii which was identified by molecular method PCR directing OXA-51 like gene. Multiplex PCR was done to determine MBL genes existence VIM, IMP & SIM. Ceftriaxone (79.48%) showing higher resistance and colistin (12.82%) showing lower resistance. All the strains were sensitive to tigecycline. The distribution of MBLs genes such as VIM 20(51.28%), IMP 5(12.82%) and SIM 0 (0%). This study showed that high level of antibiotic resistance and VIM was the most prevalent MBL genes among A. baumannii highlighting the need for indigenous antibiotic usage plan & infection control measures to prevent the spread of these resistance genes.	2022 Jul	H Ara, S K Paul, N Kobayashi, S A Nasreen, F Ahmed, S S Nila	Mymensingh Med J

36442121	Metal retention and replacement in QueD2 protect queuosine-tRNA biosynthesis in metal-starved <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>.	In response to bacterial infection, the vertebrate host employs the metal-sequestering protein calprotectin (CP) to withhold essential transition metals, notably Zn(II), to inhibit bacterial growth. Previous studies of the impact of CP-imposed transition-metal starvation in <i>A. baumannii</i> identified two enzymes in the de novo biosynthesis pathway of queuosine-transfer ribonucleic acid (Q-tRNA) that become cellularly abundant, one of which is QueD2, a 6-carboxy-5,6,7,8-tetrahydropterin (6-CPH<sub>4</sub>) synthase that catalyzes the initial, committed step of the pathway. Here, we show that CP strongly disrupts Q incorporation into tRNA. As such, we compare the <i>Ab</i>QueD2 "low-zinc" paralog with a housekeeping, obligatory Zn(II)-dependent enzyme QueD. The crystallographic structure of Zn(II)-bound <i>Ab</i>QueD2 reveals a distinct catalytic site coordination sphere and assembly state relative to QueD and possesses a dynamic loop, immediately adjacent to the catalytic site that coordinates a second Zn(II) in the structure. One of these loop-coordinating residues is an invariant Cys18, that protects QueD2 from dissociation of the catalytic Zn(II) while maintaining flux through the Q-tRNA biosynthesis pathway in cells. We propose a "metal retention" model where Cys18 introduces coordinative plasticity into the catalytic site which slows metal release, while also enhancing the metal promiscuity such that Fe(II) becomes an active cofactor. These studies reveal a complex, multipronged evolutionary adaptation to cellular Zn(II) limitation in a key Zn(II) metalloenzyme in an important human pathogen.	2022 Dec	Matthew R Jordan, Giovanni Gonzalez-Gutierrez, Jonathan C Trinidad, David P Giedroc	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A
35975993	A Novel Triple Combination To Combat Serious Infections with Carbapenem-Resistant Acinetobacter baumannii in a Mouse Pneumonia Model.	The ongoing crisis of antimicrobial resistance demands novel combinations between antimicrobials and nonantimicrobials to manage infections caused by highly resistant pathogens. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of combining sodium ascorbate and/or apo-transferrin with imipenem, forming double and triple combinations, against 20 multiple-carbapenemase-producing Acinetobacter baumannii strains using the checkerboard test, time-kill assay, and disc diffusion test. The results of the checkerboard assay revealed that all double combinations showed indifference, while only triple combination recorded a synergistic effect (fractional inhibitory concentration index [FICI] < 0.8) in 95% the test isolates. Moreover, the MIC of imipenem (MIC<sub>imp</sub>) was strongly reduced (up to 128-fold reduction) after treatment with the triple combination against highly resistant isolates and reached the susceptible range. The time-kill assay revealed that the triple combination led to a 4-log<sub>10</sub> reduction in the CFU at 8 h compared with the initial bacterial count, and no viable count was recorded at 10 h. The mouse pneumonia model showed restoration of lung function and structure, with mild to moderate residual inflammation and moderately congested vessels observed 8 h following administration of the triple rescue therapy. Additionally, normal lungs with normal patent alveoli were detected 72 h following treatment. Accordingly, sodium ascorbate and apo-transferrin are promising adjunct biological agents with the potential to restore the effectiveness of critically essential antibiotics like imipenem, commonly used for the treatment of A. baumannii infections. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Combination therapy provides a perspective to threat multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains. The present study sheds light on a novel and effective triple combination against carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii. Our <i>in vitro</i> results showed that combining imipenem with apo-transferrin and sodium ascorbate yielded synergism in 95% of test isolates, and this was associated with a marked reduction in imipenem MIC, shifting it below the breakpoint. Furthermore, a bactericidal effect was recorded, with no viable count detected at 10 h. An <i>in vivo</i> murine model of pneumonia was induced to mimic human disease. The triple combination therapy restored lung function and structure, with mild to moderate residual inflammation and moderately congested vessels observed 8 h following the initiation of therapy. Therefore, our findings suggest novel insights about a promising new combination therapy against highly resistant carbapenemase-producing A. baumannii to restore the effectiveness of imipenem.	2022 Oct	Lamiaa A Al-Madboly	Microbiol Spectr
36400832	Green synthesis of chitosan nanoparticles, optimization, characterization and antibacterial efficacy against multi drug resistant biofilm-forming Acinetobacter baumannii.	Chitosan nanoparticles (CNPs) are promising versatile cationic polymeric nanoparticles, which have received growing interest over last few decades. The biocompatibility, biodegradability, environmental safety and non-toxicity of the chitosan nanoparticles makes it preferred for a wide range of biological applications including agriculture, medical and pharmaceutical fields. In this study, CNPs were biosynthesized by aqueous extract of Eucalyptus globulus Labill fresh leaves as bio-reductant. Box-Behnken design in 29 experimental runs was used for optimization of different factors affecting the production of CNPs. The maximum yield of CNPs was 9.91 mg/mL at pH of 4.5, chitosan concentration of 1%, incubation time of 60 min and temperature of 50 °C. The crystallinity, particle size and morphology of the biosynthesized CNPs were characterized. The CNPs possess a positively charged surface of 31.1 mV. The SEM images of the CNPs confirms the formation of spherical form with smooth surface. The TEM images show CNPs were spherical in shape and their size range was between 6.92 and 10.10 nm. X-ray diffraction indicates the high degree of CNPs crystallinity. FTIR analysis revealed various functional groups of organic compounds including NH, NH<sub>2</sub>, C-H, C-O, C-N, O-H, C-C, C-OH and C-O-C. The thermogravimetric analysis results revealed that CNPs are thermally stable. The antibacterial activity of CNPs was determined against pathogenic multidrug-resistant bacteria, Acinetobacter baumannii. The diameters of the inhibition zones were 12, 16 and 30 mm using the concentrations of 12.5, 25 and 50 mg/mL; respectively. When compared to previous studies, the biosynthesized CNPs produced using an aqueous extract of fresh Eucalyptus globulus Labill leaves have the smallest particle sizes (with a size range between 6.92 and 10.10 nm). Consequently, it is a promising candidate for a diverse range of medical applications and pharmaceutical industries.	2022 Nov	Noura El-Ahmady El-Naggar, Alaa M Shiha, Hoda Mahrous, A B Abeer Mohammed	Sci Rep
37067411	High Genetic Diversity of Carbapenem-Resistant Acinetobacter baumannii Isolates Recovered in Nigerian Hospitals in 2016 to 2020.	Acinetobacter baumannii causes difficult-to-treat infections mostly among immunocompromised patients. Clinically relevant A. baumannii lineages and their carbapenem resistance mechanisms are sparsely described in Nigeria. This study aimed to characterize the diversity and genetic mechanisms of carbapenem resistance among A. baumannii strains isolated from hospitals in southwestern Nigeria. We sequenced the genomes of all A. baumannii isolates submitted to Nigeria's antimicrobial resistance surveillance reference laboratory between 2016 and 2020 on an Illumina platform and performed <i>in silico</i> genomic characterization. Selected strains were sequenced using the Oxford Nanopore technology to characterize the genetic context of carbapenem resistance genes. The 86 A. baumannii isolates were phylogenetically diverse and belonged to 35 distinct Oxford sequence types (<sup>oxf</sup>STs), 16 of which were novel, and 28 Institut Pasteur STs (<sup>pas</sup>STs). Thirty-eight (44.2%) isolates belonged to none of the known international clones (ICs). Over 50% of the isolates were phenotypically resistant to 10 of 12 tested antimicrobials. The majority (<i>n</i> = 54) of the isolates were carbapenem resistant, particularly the IC7 (<sup>pas</sup>ST25; 100%) and IC9 (<sup>pas</sup>ST85; >91.7%) strains. <i>bla</i><sub>OXA-23</sub> (34.9%) and <i>bla</i><sub>NDM-1</sub> (27.9%) were the most common carbapenem resistance genes detected. All <i>bla</i><sub>OXA-23</sub> genes were carried on Tn<i>2006</i> or Tn<i>2006</i>-like transposons. Our findings suggest that a 10-kb Tn<i>125</i> composite transposon is the primary means of <i>bla</i><sub>NDM-1</sub> dissemination. Our findings highlight an increase in <i>bla</i><sub>NDM-1</sub> prevalence and the widespread transposon-facilitated dissemination of carbapenemase genes in diverse A. baumannii lineages in southwestern Nigeria. We make the case for improving surveillance of these pathogens in Nigeria and other understudied settings. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Acinetobacter baumannii bacteria are increasingly clinically relevant due to their propensity to harbor genes conferring resistance to multiple antimicrobials, as well as their ability to persist and disseminate in hospital environments and cause difficult-to-treat nosocomial infections. Little is known about the molecular epidemiology and antimicrobial resistance profiles of these organisms in Nigeria, largely due to limited capacity for their isolation, identification, and antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Our study characterized the diversity and antimicrobial resistance profiles of clinical A. baumannii in southwestern Nigeria using whole-genome sequencing. We also identified the key genetic elements facilitating the dissemination of carbapenem resistance genes within this species. This study provides key insights into the clinical burden and population dynamics of A. baumannii in hospitals in Nigeria and highlights the importance of routine whole-genome sequencing-based surveillance of this and other previously understudied pathogens in Nigeria and other similar settings.	2023 Apr	Erkison Ewomazino Odih, Anderson O Oaikhena, Anthony Underwood, Yaovi Mahuton Gildas Hounmanou, Oyinlola O Oduyebo, Abayomi Fadeyi, Aaron O Aboderin, Veronica O Ogunleye, Silvia Argimón, Vitus Nnaemeka Akpunonu, Phillip O Oshun, Abiodun Egwuenu, Tochi J Okwor, Chikwe Ihekweazu, David M Aanensen, Anders Dalsgaard, Iruka N Okeke	mSphere

36189532	Prevalence of Virulence Genes in Acinetobacter baumannii Isolated from Clinical Samples in Mymensingh Medical College Hospital, Bangladesh.	Acinetobacter baumannii is an opportunistic bacterial pathogen that is the most important cause of hospital-acquired infections. The objective of this study was to evaluate the predominance and determination of virulence encoding genes in A. baumannii isolates. During this cross-sectional study period from February 2019 to March 2020 of 380 clinical samples including endotracheal aspirates (70), wound swab or pus (175), urine (70) and blood (65) analysed in inpatients admitted to the hospital in different unit like ICU, Surgery and Burn unit of Mymensingh Medical College Hospital. Out of 380 studied samples, 130(34.21%) strains were yielded growth. Among 130 isolates, Acinetobacter spp. was 49(37.69%). Totally, 39(79.59%) were Acinetobacter baumannii which was detected by molecular technique PCR. Further more, the determination of virulence genes csgA and fimH detected by PCR. Among two studied virulence genes, csgA (38.46%) was the most prevalent virulent genes associated with disease severity and co-morbidity of the patient in A. baumannii infections.	2022 Oct	H Ara, S K Paul, N Kobayashi, S A Nasreen, F Ahmed	Mymensingh Med J
36225352	Engineering of lysin by fusion of antimicrobial peptide (cecropin A) enhances its antibacterial properties against multidrug-resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>.	Most clinical isolates of <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>, a nosocomial pathogen, are multidrug-resistant (MDR), fueling the search for alternative therapies. Bacteriophage-derived endolysins have potent antibacterial activities and are considered as alternatives to antibiotics against <i>A. baumannii</i> infection. Gram-negative bacteria possess outer lipid membrane that prevents direct contact between the endolysins and the cell wall. We hypothesized that the fusion of antimicrobial peptide (AMP) with endolysin could help to reduce bacterial endolysin resistance and increase antimicrobial activity by membrane permeability action. Accordingly, we fused cecropin A, a commonly used AMP, with the N-terminus of AbEndolysin, which enhances the bactericidal activity of the chimeric endolysin. The bactericidal activity of cecropin A-fused AbEndolysin increased by at least 2-8 fold for various MDR <i>A. baumannii</i> clinical isolates. The <i>in vitro</i> bactericidal activity results also showed higher bacterial lysis by the chimeric endolysin than that by the parental lysin. The engineered AbEndolysin (eAbEndolysin) showed synergistic effects with the beta-lactam antibiotics cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and aztreonam, and an additive effect with meropenem and imipenem. eAbEndolysin had no cytotoxic effect on A549 cell line and rescued mice (40% survival rate) from systemic <i>A. baumannii</i> infection. Together, these findings suggest the potential of lysin therapy and may prompt its use as an alternative to antibiotics.	2022	Md Maidul Islam, Dooyoung Kim, Kyeongmin Kim, Su-Jin Park, Samia Akter, Jeongah Kim, Seunghyeok Bang, Shukho Kim, Jungmin Kim, Je Chul Lee, Chang-Won Hong, Minsang Shin	Front Microbiol

35638734	InvL, an Invasin-Like Adhesin, Is a Type II Secretion System Substrate Required for Acinetobacter baumannii Uropathogenesis.	Acinetobacter baumannii is an opportunistic pathogen of growing concern, as isolates are commonly multidrug resistant. While A. baumannii is most frequently associated with pulmonary infections, a significant proportion of clinical isolates come from urinary sources, highlighting its uropathogenic potential. The type II secretion system (T2SS) of commonly used model Acinetobacter strains is important for virulence in various animal models, but the potential role of the T2SS in urinary tract infection (UTI) remains unknown. Here, we used a catheter-associated UTI (CAUTI) model to demonstrate that a modern urinary isolate, UPAB1, requires the T2SS for full virulence. A proteomic screen to identify putative UPAB1 T2SS effectors revealed an uncharacterized lipoprotein with structural similarity to the intimin-invasin family, which serve as type V secretion system (T5SS) adhesins required for the pathogenesis of several bacteria. This protein, designated InvL, lacked the β-barrel domain associated with T5SSs but was confirmed to require the T2SS for both surface localization and secretion. This makes InvL the first identified T2SS effector belonging to the intimin-invasin family. InvL was confirmed to be an adhesin, as the protein bound to extracellular matrix components and mediated adhesion to urinary tract cell lines <i>in vitro</i>. Additionally, the <i>invL</i> mutant was attenuated in the CAUTI model, indicating a role in Acinetobacter uropathogenesis. Finally, bioinformatic analyses revealed that InvL is present in nearly all clinical isolates belonging to international clone 2, a lineage of significant clinical importance. In all, we conclude that the T2SS substrate InvL is an adhesin required for A. baumannii uropathogenesis. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> While pathogenic Acinetobacter can cause various infections, we recently found that 20% of clinical isolates come from urinary sources. Despite the clinical relevance of Acinetobacter as a uropathogen, few virulence factors involved in urinary tract colonization have been defined. Here, we identify a novel type II secretion system effector, InvL, which is required for full uropathogenesis by a modern urinary isolate. Although InvL has predicted structural similarity to the intimin-invasin family of autotransporter adhesins, InvL is predicted to be anchored to the membrane as a lipoprotein. Similar to other invasin homologs, however, we demonstrate that InvL is a bona fide adhesin capable of binding extracellular matrix components and mediating adhesion to urinary tract cell lines. In all, this work establishes InvL as an adhesin important for Acinetobacter<i>'</i>s urinary tract virulence and represents the first report of a type II secretion system effector belonging to the intimin-invasin family.	2022 Jun	Clay D Jackson-Litteken, Gisela Di Venanzio, Nguyen-Hung Le, Nichollas E Scott, Bardya Djahanschiri, Jesus S Distel, Evan J Pardue, Ingo Ebersberger, Mario F Feldman	mBio
36622157	Blue Light Sensing BlsA-Mediated Modulation of Meropenem Resistance and Biofilm Formation in Acinetobacter baumannii.	The presence or absence of BlsA, a protein with a blue light-sensing flavin domain in the genomes of Acinetobacter species has aroused curiosity about its roles in the regulation of bacterial lifestyle under light. Genomic and transcriptomic analyses revealed the loss of BlsA in several multidrug-resistant (MDR) A. baumannii strains as well as the light-mediated induction of <i>blsA</i>, along with a possible BlsA-interacting partner BipA. Their direct <i>in vivo</i> interactions were verified using a bacterial two-hybrid system. The results demonstrated that the C-terminal region of BipA could bind to the C-terminal residues of BlsA under blue light at 23°C but not at 37°C. Genetic manipulations of <i>blsA</i> and <i>bipA</i> revealed that the coexistence of BlsA and BipA was required to induce the light-dependent expression of <i>ompA</i> in A. baumannii ATCC 17978 at 23°C. The same phenomenon occurred in the BlsA-deficient MDR strain in our functional complementation assay; however, the underlying molecular mechanism remains poorly understood. BlsA-modulated amounts of OmpA, the most abundant porin, in the outer membrane affected the membrane integrity and permeability of small molecules. Dark conditions or the deletion of <i>ompA</i> made the membrane more permeable to lipophilic ethidium bromide (EtBr) but not to meropenem. Interestingly, light illumination and low temperature conditions made the cells more sensitive to meropenem; however, this bactericidal effect was not noted in the <i>blsA</i> mutant or in the BlsA-deficient MDR strains. Light-mediated cell death and the reduction of biofilm formation at 23°C were abolished in the <i>blsA</i> mutant strain, suggesting multifaceted roles of BlsA in A. baumannii strains. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Little is known about the functional roles of BlsA and its interacting partners in Acinetobacter species. Intriguingly, no BlsA homolog was found in several clinical isolates, suggesting that BlsA was not required inside the host because of the lack of blue light and the warm temperature conditions. As many chromophore-harboring proteins interact with various partners to control light-dependent cellular behaviors, the maintenance of <i>blsA</i> in the genomes of many Acinetobacter species during their evolution may be beneficial when fluctuations occur in two important environmental factors: light and temperature. Our study is the first to report the novel protein partner of BlsA, namely, BipA, and its contribution to multiple phenotypic changes, including meropenem resistance and biofilm formation. Rapid physiological acclimation to changing light or temperature conditions may be possible in the presence of the light-sensing BlsA protein, which may have more interacting partners than expected.	2023 Feb	Jihye Yang, Sohyeon Yun, Woojun Park	mSystems

33685901	Semi-mechanistic PK/PD modelling of fosfomycin and sulbactam combination against carbapenem-resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>.	Due to limited treatment options for carbapenem-resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> (CR-AB) infections, antibiotic combinations are now considered potential treatments for CR-AB. This study aimed to explore the utility of fosfomycin-sulbactam combination (FOS/SUL) therapy against CR-AB isolates.Synergism of FOS/SUL against 50 clinical CR-AB isolates were screened using the checkerboard method. Thereafter, time-kill studies against two CR-AB isolates were performed. The time-kill data were described using a semi-mechanistic pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) model. Monte Carlo simulations were then performed to estimate the probability of stasis, 1-log kill and 2-log kill after 24-hours with combination therapy.The FOS/SUL combination demonstrated a synergistic effect against 74% of isolates. No antagonism was observed. The MIC<sub>50</sub> and MIC<sub>90</sub> of FOS/SUL were decreased four- to eight-fold, compared to the monotherapy MIC<sub>50</sub> and MIC<sub>90</sub> In the time-kill studies, the combination displayed bactericidal activity against both isolates and synergistic activity against one isolate, at the highest clinically achievable concentrations. Our PK/PD model was able to describe the interaction between fosfomycin and sulbactam <i>in vitro</i> Bacterial kill was mainly driven by sulbactam, with fosfomycin augmentation. FOS/SUL regimens that included sulbactam 4 g every 8 hours, demonstrated a probability of target attainment of 1-log<sub>10</sub> kill at 24 h of ∼69-76%, as compared to ∼15-30% with monotherapy regimens at the highest doses.The reduction in the MIC values and the achievement of a moderate PTA of a 2-log<sub>10</sub> reduction in bacterial burden demonstrated that FOS/SUL may potentially be effective against some CR-AB infections.	2023 May	S Mohd Sazlly Lim, A J Heffernan, J A Roberts, F B Sime	Antimicrob Agents Chemother
36413083	Characterization of a glycoside hydrolase endolysin from Acinetobacter baumannii phage AbTZA1 with high antibacterial potency and novel structural features.	The classification of Acinetobacter baumannii by WHO as 'priority 1' antibiotic-resistant pathogen underlines the urgent need for novel antimicrobial agents towards this pathogen. In this work, screening of the A. baumannii phage AbTZA1 genome allowed the identification of a putative endolysin (AbLys1, EC3.2.1.17) that belongs to the glycoside hydrolase family 24 (GH24). The sequence of AbLys1 was cloned, expressed in E. coli and purified. The lytic activity and specificity of AbLys1 were evaluated against a range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative human pathogens. AbLys1 was found to display a high selectivity towards A. baumannii. Kinetic analysis was carried out to characterize the dependence of its lytic activity on pH. The enzyme shows its maximal activity at pH values 7-8. The structure of AbLys1 was determined by X-ray crystallography to 1.82 Å resolution. The overall structure revealed two helical domains: a small, antenna-like, N-terminal domain and a larger C-terminal domain with six α-helices and a β-hairpin. Both the antenna-like and β-hairpin regions contain short sequences (AMseq1 and AMseq2) with predicted antimicrobial activity. Engineering studies revealed a key role of AMseq1 and AMseq2 on the enzyme's lytic activity towards A. baumannii cells but not towards purified peptidoglycan. This suggests that both sequences affect the destabilization of the outer membrane, thus providing access of the catalytic domain to the peptidoglycan. In addition, the deletion of AMseq1 enhanced the enzyme stability, whereas the deletion of AMseq2 diminished it. The results suggest that AbLys1 is a promising new enzybiotic with efficient lytic and antimicrobial activity.	2023 Apr	Georgios E Premetis, Angeliki Stathi, Anastassios C Papageorgiou, Nikolaos E Labrou	FEBS J
36545493	Characterizing the role of phosphatidylglycerol-phosphate phosphatases in <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> cell envelope biogenesis and antibiotic resistance.	The dissemination of multi-drug resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> threatens global healthcare systems and necessitates the development of novel therapeutic options. The Gram-negative bacterial cell envelope provides a first defensive barrier against antimicrobial assault. Essential components of this multi-layered complex are the phospholipid-rich membranes. Phosphatidylglycerol phosphate (PGP) phosphatases are responsible for a key step in the biosynthesis of a major phospholipid species, phosphatidylglycerol (PG), but these enzymes have also been implicated in the biogenesis of other cell envelope components. Our bioinformatics analyses identified two putative PGP candidates in the <i>A. baumannii</i> genome, PgpA and PgpB. Phospholipid analyses of isogenic <i>pgpA</i> mutants in two distinct <i>A. baumannii</i> strains revealed a shift in the desaturation levels of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) phospholipid species, possibly due to the activation of the phospholipid desaturase DesA. We also investigated the impact of the inner membrane phosphatases on other cell envelope components, which revealed a role of PgpB in the maintenance of the <i>A. baumannii</i> peptidoglycan layer, and consequently carbapenem resistance. Collectively, this work provides novel insights into the roles of PGP phosphatases on the global lipidomic landscape of <i>A. baumannii</i> and their interconnectivity with the biogenesis of other cell envelope components. The non-essentiality of these candidates exemplifies metabolic versatility of <i>A. baumannii</i>, which is believed to be key to its success as global pathogen.	2023 Dec	Maoge Zang, Alice Ascari, Felise G Adams, Saleh Alquethamy, Bart A Eijkelkamp	Cell Surf
36301313	Quaternary Phosphonium Compound Unveiled as a Potent Disinfectant against Highly Resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> Clinical Isolates.	<i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> is classified as a highest threat pathogen, urgently necessitating novel antimicrobials that evade resistance to combat its spread. Quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs) have afforded a valuable first line of defense against antimicrobial resistant pathogens as broad-spectrum amphiphilic disinfectant molecules. However, a paucity of innovation in this space has driven the emergence of QAC resistance. Through this work, we sought to identify next-generation disinfectant molecules with efficacy against highly resistant <i>A. baumannii</i> clinical isolates. We selected 12 best-in-class molecules from our previous investigations of quaternary ammonium and quaternary phosphonium compounds (QPCs) to test against a panel of 35 resistant <i>A. baumannii</i> clinical isolates. The results highlighted the efficacy of our next-generation compounds over leading commercial QACs, with our best-in-class QAC (2Pyr-11,11) and QPC (P6P-10,10) displaying improved activities with a few exceptions. Furthermore, we elucidated a correlation between colistin resistance and QAC resistance, wherein the only pan-resistant isolate of the panel, also harboring colistin resistance, exhibited resistance to all tested QACs. Notably, P6P-10,10 maintained efficacy against this strain with an IC<sub>90</sub> of 3 μM. In addition, P6P-10,10 displayed minimum biofilm eradication concentrations as low as 32 μM against extensively drug resistant clinical isolates. Lastly, examining the development of disinfectant resistance and cross-resistance, we generated QAC-resistant <i>A. baumannii</i> mutants and observed the development of QAC cross-resistance. In contrast, neither disinfectant resistance nor cross-resistance was observed in <i>A. baumannii</i> under P6P-10,10 treatment. Taken together, the results of this work illustrate the need for novel disinfectant compounds to treat resistant pathogens, such as <i>A. baumannii</i>, and underscore the promise of QPCs, such as P6P-10,10, as viable next-generation disinfectant molecules.	2022 Nov	Marina E Michaud, Ryan A Allen, Kelly R Morrison-Lewis, Christian A Sanchez, Kevin P C Minbiole, Savannah J Post, William M Wuest	ACS Infect Dis
36377939	Structural Basis of PER-1-Mediated Cefiderocol Resistance and Synergistic Inhibition of PER-1 by Cefiderocol in Combination with Avibactam or Durlobactam in Acinetobacter baumannii.	Cefiderocol is a novel siderophore cephalosporin that displays activity against Gram-negative bacteria. To establish cefiderocol susceptibility levels of Acinetobacter baumannii strains from China, we performed susceptibility testing and genomic analyses on 131 clinical isolates. Cefiderocol shows high activity against the strains. The production of PER-1 is the key mechanism of cefiderocol resistance. <i>In silico</i> studies predicted that avibactam and durlobactam could inhibit cefiderocol hydrolysis by PER-1, which was confirmed by determining cefiderocol MICs in combination with inhibitors.	2022 Dec	Xiaochen Liu, Tailong Lei, Yunxing Yang, Linghong Zhang, Haiyang Liu, Sebastian Leptihn, Yunsong Yu, Xiaoting Hua	Antimicrob Agents Chemother
37210019	Insights into the genetic contexts of sulfonamide resistance among early clinical isolates of Acinetobacter baumannii.	Since the late 1930s, resistance to sulfonamides has been accumulating across bacterial species including Acinetobacter baumannii, an opportunistic pathogen increasingly implicated the spread of antimicrobial resistance worldwide. Our study aimed to explore events involved in the acquisition of sulfonamide resistance genes, particularly sul2, among the earliest available isolates of A. baumannii. The study utilized the genomic data of 19 strains of A. baumannii isolated before 1985. The whole genomes of 5 clinical isolates obtained from the Culture Collection University of Göteborg (CCUG), Sweden, were sequenced using the Illumina MiSeq system. Acquired resistance genes, insertion sequence elements and plasmids were detected using ResFinder, ISfinder and Plasmidseeker, respectively, while sequence types (STs) were assigned using the PubMLST Pasteur scheme. BLASTn was used to verify the occurrence of sul genes and to map their genetic surroundings. The sul1 and sul2 genes were detected in 4 and 9 isolates, respectively. Interestingly, sul2 appeared thirty years earlier than sul1. The sul2 gene was first located in the genomic island GIsul2 located on a plasmid, hereafter called NCTC7364p. With the emergence of international clone 1, the genetic context of sul2 evolved toward transposon Tn6172, which was also plasmid-mediated. Sulfonamide resistance in A. baumannii was efficiently acquired and transferred vertically, e.g., among the ST52 and ST1 isolates, as well as horizontally among non-related strains by means of a few efficient transposons and plasmids. Timely acquisition of the sul genes has probably contributed to the survival skill of A. baumannii under the high antimicrobial stress of hospital settings.	2023 May	Anju Bala, Bernt Eric Uhlin, Nabil Karah	Infect Genet Evol
36948128	Structure-activity relationships of actively FhuE transported rifabutin derivatives with potent activity against Acinetobacter baumannii.	Hospital-acquired infections are on the rise and represent both, a clinical and financial burden. With resistance emerging and an ever-dwindling armamentarium at hand, infections caused by Acinetobacter baumannii are particularly problematic, since these bacteria have a high level of resistance and resilience to traditional and even last-resort antibiotics. The antibiotic rifabutin was recently found to show potent in vitro and in vivo activity against extensively drug resistant A. baumannii. Building on this discovery, we report on the synthesis and activity of rifabutin analogs, with a focus on N-functionalization of the piperidine ring. The antimicrobial testing uncovered structure activity relationships (SAR) for A. baumannii that were not reflected in Staphylococcus aureus. The cellular activity did not correlate with cell-free transcription inhibition, but with bacterial intracellular compound accumulation. Mass spectrometry-based accumulation studies confirmed the involvement of the siderophore receptor FhuE in active compound translocation at low concentrations, and they showed a strong impact of the culture medium on the accumulation of rifabutin. Overall, the study underlines the structural feature required for strong accumulation of rifabutin in A. baumannii and identifies analogs as or more potent than rifabutin against A. baumannii.	2023 Apr	M Maingot, M Bourotte, A C Vetter, B Schellhorn, K Antraygues, H Scherer, M Gitzinger, C Kemmer, G E Dale, O Defert, S Lociuro, M Brönstrup, N Willand, V Trebosc	Eur J Med Chem
37130458	Structure of YdjH from Acinetobacter baumannii revealed an active site of YdjH family sugar kinase.	Bacterial sugar kinase is a central enzyme for proper sugar degradation in bacteria, essential for survival and growth. Therefore, this enzyme family is a primary target for antibacterial drug development, with YdjH most preferring to phosphorylate higher-order monosaccharides with a carboxylate terminus. Sugar kinases express diverse specificity and functions, making specificity determination of this family a prominent issue. This study examines the YdjH crystal structure from Acinetobacter baumannii (abYdjH), which has an exceptionally high antibiotic resistance and is considered a superbug. Our structural and biochemical study revealed that abYdjH has a widely open lid domain and is a solution dimer. In addition, the putative active site of abYdjH was determined based on structural analysis, sequence comparison, and in silico docking. Finally, we proposed the active site-forming residues that determine various sugar specificities from abYdjH. This study contributes towards a deeper understanding of the phosphorylation process and bacterial sugar metabolism of YdjH family to design the next-generation antibiotics for targeting A. baumannii.	2023 Apr	Gwan Hee Lee, Ju Hyeong Kim, Hyun Ji Ha, Hyun Ho Park	Biochem Biophys Res Commun

36895415	Identification and prioritization of potential therapeutic molecules against LpxA from <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> - A computational study.	A. baumannii is a ubiquitously found gram-negative, multi-drug resistant bacterial species from the ESKAPE family of pathogens known to be the causative agent for hospital-acquired infections such as pneumonia, meningitis, endocarditis, septicaemia and urinary tract infections. <i>A. baumannii</i> is implicated as a contributor to bloodstream infections in approximately 2% of all worldwide infections. Hence, exploring novel therapeutic agents against the bacterium is essential. LpxA or UDP-<i>N</i>-acetylglucosamine acetyltransferase is an essential enzyme important in Lipid A biosynthesis which catalyses the reversible transfer of an acetyl group on the glucosamine 3-OH of the UDP-GlcNAc which is a crucial step in the biosynthesis of the protective Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) layer of the bacteria which upon disruption can lead to the elimination of the bacterium which delineates LpxA as an appreciable drug target from <i>A. baumannii</i>. The present study performs high throughput virtual screening of LpxA against the enamine-HTSC-large-molecule library and performs toxicity and ADME screening to identify the three promising lead molecules subjected to molecular dynamics simulations. Global and essential dynamics analysis of LpxA and its complexes along with FEL and MM/PBSA based binding free energy delineate Z367461724 and Z219244584 as potential inhibitors against LpxA from <i>A. baumannii</i>.	2023	Rameez Jabeer Khan, Ekampreet Singh, Rajat Kumar Jha, Ankit Kumar, Saurabh Kumar Bhati, Mahrukh Parveez Zia, Monika Jain, Rashmi Prabha Singh, Jayaraman Muthukumaran, Amit Kumar Singh	Curr Res Struct Biol

36602381	The Protective Role of Interleukin 17A in Acinetobacter baumannii Pneumonia Is Associated with Candida albicans in the Airway.	Recent studies have found that the coexistence of fungi and bacteria in the airway may increase the risk of infection, contribute to the development of pneumonia, and increase the severity of disease. Interleukin 17A (IL-17A) plays important roles in host resistance to bacterial and fungal infections. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of IL-17A on Acinetobacter baumannii-infected rats with a previous Candida albicans airway inoculation. The incidence of A. baumannii pneumonia was higher in rats with C. albicans in the airway than in noninoculated rats, and it decreased when amphotericin B was used to clear C. albicans, which influenced IL-17A levels. IL-17A had a protective effect in A. baumannii pneumonia associated with C. albicans in the airway. Compared with A. baumannii-infected rats with C. albicans in the airway that did not receive IL-17A, recombinant IL-17A (rIL-17A) supplementation decreased the incidence of A. baumannii pneumonia (10/15 versus 5/17; <i>P = </i>0.013) and the proportion of neutrophils in the lung (84 ± 3.5 versus 74 ± 4.3%; <i>P = </i>0.033), reduced tissue destruction and inflammation, and decreased levels of myeloperoxidase (MPO) (1.267 ± 0.15 versus 0.233 ± 0.06 U/g; <i>P = </i>0.0004), reactive oxygen species (ROS) (132,333 ± 7,505 versus 64,667 ± 10,115 AU; <i>P = </i>0.0007) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (2.736 ± 0.05 versus 2.1816 ± 0.29 U/g; <i>P = </i>0.0313). <i>In vitro</i> experiments revealed that IL-17A had no significant effect on the direct migration ability and bactericidal capability of neutrophils. However, IL-17A restrained lysis cell death and increased apoptosis of neutrophils (2.9 ± 1.14 versus 7 ± 0.5%; <i>P = </i>0.0048). Taken together, our results suggest that C. albicans can depress IL-17A levels, which when supplemented may have a regulatory function that limits the accumulation of neutrophils in inflammatory areas, providing inflammatory response homeostasis.	2023 Jan	Jiaxin Tang, Jiamin Li, Jinqing Pan, Xiaoyuan Shen, Xiangsheng Ye, Jiamin Zhou, Ni Wang, Liang Xie, Beth Burgwyn Fuchs, Michail S Lionakis, Eleftherios Mylonakis, Xiaojiang Tan	Infect Immun
37144752	Interaction and simulation studies suggest the possible molecular targets of intrinsically disordered amyloidogenic antimicrobial peptides in <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>.	<i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> is one of the causing agents of nosocomial infections. A wide range of antibiotics fails to work against these pathogens. Hence, there is an urgent requirement to develop other therapeutics to solve this problem. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are a diverse group of naturally occurring peptides that have the ability to kill diverse groups of microorganisms. The major challenge of using AMPs as therapeutics is their unstable nature and the fact that most of their molecular targets are still unknown. In this study, we have selected intrinsically disordered and amyloidogenic AMPs, showing activity against <i>A. baumannii</i>, that is, Bactenecin, Cath BF, Citropin 1.1, DP7, NA-CATH, Tachyplesin, and WAM-1. To identify the probable target of these AMPs in <i>A. baumannii</i>, calculation of docking score, binding energy, dissociation constant, and molecular dynamics analysis was performed with selected seventeen possible molecular targets. The result showed that the most probable molecular targets of most of the intrinsically disordered amyloidogenic AMPs were UDP-N-acetylenol-pyruvoyl-glucosamine reductase (MurB), followed by 33-36 kDa outer membrane protein (Omp 33-36), UDP-N-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanyl-d-glutamate-2,6-diaminopimelate ligase (MurE), and porin Subfamily Protein (PorinSubF). Further, molecular dynamics analysis concluded that the target of antimicrobial peptide Bactenecin is MurB of <i>A. baumannii</i>, and identified other molecular targets of selected AMPs. Additionally, the oligomerization capacity of the selected AMPs was also investigated, and it was shown that the selected AMPs form oligomeric states, and interact with their molecular targets in that state. Experimental validation using purified AMPs and molecular targets needs to be done to confirm the interaction.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

36099298	Deletion of a previously uncharacterized lipoprotein lirL confers resistance to an inhibitor of type II signal peptidase in <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>.	<i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> is a clinically important, predominantly health care-associated gram-negative bacterium with high rates of emerging resistance worldwide. Given the urgent need for novel antibacterial therapies against <i>A. baumannii</i>, we focused on inhibiting lipoprotein biosynthesis, a pathway that is essential for envelope biogenesis in gram-negative bacteria. The natural product globomycin, which inhibits the essential type II signal peptidase prolipoprotein signal peptidase (LspA), is ineffective against wild-type <i>A. baumannii</i> clinical isolates due to its poor penetration through the outer membrane. Here, we describe a globomycin analog, G5132, that is more potent against wild-type and clinical <i>A. baumannii</i> isolates. Mutations leading to G5132 resistance in <i>A. baumannii</i> map to the signal peptide of a single hypothetical gene, which we confirm encodes an alanine-rich lipoprotein and have renamed <i>lirL</i> (prolipoprotein signal peptidase inhibitor resistance lipoprotein). LirL is a highly abundant lipoprotein primarily localized to the inner membrane. Deletion of <i>lirL</i> leads to G5132 resistance, inefficient cell division, increased sensitivity to serum, and attenuated virulence. Signal peptide mutations that confer resistance to G5132 lead to the accumulation of diacylglyceryl-modified LirL prolipoprotein in untreated cells without significant loss in cell viability, suggesting that these mutations overcome a block in lipoprotein biosynthetic flux by decreasing LirL prolipoprotein substrate sensitivity to processing by LspA. This study characterizes a lipoprotein that plays a critical role in resistance to LspA inhibitors and validates lipoprotein biosynthesis as a antibacterial target in <i>A. baumannii</i>.	2022 Sep	Ke-Jung Huang, Homer Pantua, Jingyu Diao, Elizabeth Skippington, Michael Volny, Wendy Sandoval, Varnesh Tiku, Yutian Peng, Meredith Sagolla, Donghong Yan, Jing Kang, Anand Kumar Katakam, Nairie Michaelian, Mike Reichelt, Man-Wah Tan, Cary D Austin, Min Xu, Emily Hanan, Sharookh B Kapadia	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A
36951717	Azolylpyrimidinediols as Novel Structural Scaffolds of DNA-Groove Binders against Intractable <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>.	A unique class of antibacterial azolylpyrimidinediols (APDs) and their analogues were developed. Some synthesized compounds showed excellent bacteriostatic potency; especially, triazolylpyrimidinediol (triazolyl PD) <b>7a</b> exhibited good anti-<i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> potential with a low MIC of 0.002 mmol/L. Triazolyl PD <b>7a</b> with inconspicuous cytotoxicity and hemolytic activity could eradicate the established biofilm, showed low resistance, and exhibited favorable drug-likeness. Mechanistic explorations revealed that compound <b>7a</b> without membrane-targeting ability could decrease metabolic activity, interact with DNA through groove binding action to block DNA replication rather than intercalate into and cleave DNA, and thus inhibit bacterial growth. Further computations displayed that the low <i>E</i><sub>HOMO</sub> and large energy gap might help triazolyl PD <b>7a</b> binding to biological targets more easily. Moreover, compound <b>7a</b> gave appreciable <i>in vivo</i> pharmacokinetic properties and pharmacodynamics. These findings of azolylpyrimidinediols as novel structural scaffolds of DNA-groove binders might imply a large promise for the treatments of <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> infection.	2023 Apr	Yi-Min Tan, Ya Wang, Shuo Li, Shao-Lin Zhang, Cheng-He Zhou	J Med Chem
35869264	Specific egg yolk antibody raised to biofilm associated protein (Bap) is protective against murine pneumonia caused by Acinetobacter baumannii.	Acinetobacter baumannii easily turns into pan drug-resistant (PDR) with a high mortality rate. No effective commercial antibiotic or approved vaccine is available against drug-resistant strains of this pathogen. Egg yolk immunoglobulin (IgY) could be used as a simple and low-cost biotherapeutic against its infections. This study evaluates the prophylactic potential of IgY against A. baumannii in a murine pneumonia model. White Leghorn hens were immunized with intramuscular injection of the recombinant biofilm-associated protein (Bap) from A. baumannii on days 0, 21, 42, and 63. The reactivity and antibiofilm activity of specific IgYs raised against the Bap was evaluated by indirect ELISA and a microtiter plate assay for biofilm formation. The IgYs against Bap were able to decrease the biofilm formation ability of A. baumannii and protect the mice against the challenge of A. baumannii. IgYs antibody raised here shows a good antigen-specificity and protectivity which can be used in passive immunotherapy against A. baumannii. In conclusion, the IgY against biofilm-associated protein proves prophylactic in a murine pneumonia model.	2022 Jul	Azam Ranjbar, Iraj Rasooli, Abolfazl Jahangiri, Fatemeh Ramezanalizadeh	Sci Rep
37133639	In vitro activities of omadacycline, eravacycline, cefiderocol, apramycin, and comparator antibiotics against Acinetobacter baumannii causing bloodstream infections in Greece, 2020-2021: a multicenter study.	Resistance of Acinetobacter baumannii to multiple clinically important antimicrobials has increased to very high rates in Greece, rendering most of them obsolete. The aim of this study was to determine the molecular epidemiology and susceptibilities of A. baumannii isolates collected from different hospitals across Greece. Single-patient A. baumannii strains isolated from blood cultures (n = 271), from 19 hospitals, in a 6-month period (November 2020-April 2021) were subjected to minimum inhibitory concentration determination and molecular testing for carbapenemase, 16S rRNA methyltransferase and mcr gene detection and epidemiological evaluation. 98.9% of all isolates produced carbapenemase OXA-23. The vast majority (91.8%) of OXA-23 producers harbored the armA and were assigned mainly (94.3%) to sequence group G1, corresponding to IC II. Apramycin (EBL-1003) was the most active agent inhibiting 100% of the isolates at ≤16 mg/L, followed by cefiderocol which was active against at least 86% of them. Minocycline, colistin and ampicillin-sulbactam exhibited only sparse activity (S <19%), while eravacycline was 8- and 2-fold more active than minocycline and tigecycline respectively, by comparison of their MIC<sub>50</sub>/<sub>90</sub> values. OXA-23-ArmA producing A. baumannii of international clone II appears to be the prevailing epidemiological type of this organism in Greece. Cefiderocol could provide a useful alternative for difficult to treat Gram-negative infections, while apramycin (EBL-1003), the structurally unique aminoglycoside currently in clinical development, may represent a highly promising agent against multi-drug resistant A. baumanni infections, due to its high susceptibility rates and low toxicity.	2023 May	Irene Galani, Vassiliki Papoutsaki, Ilias Karaiskos, Nikolaos Moustakas, Lamprini Galani, Sofia Maraki, Viktoria Eirini Mavromanolaki, Olga Legga, Kimon Fountoulis, Evangelia D Platsouka, Panagiota Giannopoulou, Helen Papadogeorgaki, Maria Damala, Efrosini Chinou, Aggeliki Pasxali, Ioannis Deliolanis, Helen Vagiakou, Efthymia Petinaki, Anastasia Chli, Eleni Vagdatli, Polyzo Kazila, Vassiliki Papaioannou, Konstantina Kontopoulou, Atalia Noemi Ferke, Eleni Moraitou, Anastasia Antoniadou, Helen Giamarellou	Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis
36358238	Evaluation of Fosfomycin-Sulbactam Combination Therapy against Carbapenem-Resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> Isolates in a Hollow-Fibre Infection Model.	Static concentration in vitro studies have demonstrated that fosfomycin- or sulbactam-based combinations may be efficacious against carbapenem-resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> (CRAB). In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the bacterial killing and resistance suppression potential of fosfomycin-sulbactam combination therapies against CRAB isolates in a dynamic infection model. We simulated clinically relevant dosing regimens of fosfomycin (8 g every 8 h, 1 h infusion) and sulbactam (12 g continuous infusion or 4 g every 8 h, 4 h infusion) alone and in combination for 7 days in a hollow-fibre infection model (HFIM) against three clinical isolates of CRAB. The simulated pharmacokinetic profiles in the HFIM were based on fosfomycin and sulbactam data from critically ill patients. Fosfomycin monotherapy resulted in limited bacterial killing. Sulbactam monotherapies resulted in ~ 3 to 4 log<sub>10</sub> kill within the first 8 to 32 h followed by regrowth of up to 8 to 10 log<sub>10</sub> CFU/mL. A combination of fosfomycin and continuous infusion of sulbactam led to a ~2 to 4 log<sub>10</sub> reduction in bacterial burden within the first 24 h, which was sustained throughout the duration of the experiments. A combination of fosfomycin and extended infusion of sulbactam produced a ~4 log<sub>10</sub> reduction in colony count within 24 h. This study demonstrated that fosfomycin in combination with sulbactam is a promising option for the treatment of MDR <i>A. baumannii</i>. Further studies are needed to further assess the potential clinical utility of this combination.	2022 Nov	Sazlyna Mohd Sazlly Lim, Aaron Heffernan, Saiyuri Naicker, Steven Wallis, Jason A Roberts, Fekade Bruck Sime	Antibiotics (Basel)
35653398	Evolutionarily stable gene clusters shed light on the common grounds of pathogenicity in the Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-baumannii complex.	Nosocomial pathogens of the Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-baumannii (ACB) complex are a cautionary example for the world-wide spread of multi- and pan-drug resistant bacteria. Aiding the urgent demand for novel therapeutic targets, comparative genomics studies between pathogens and their apathogenic relatives shed light on the genetic basis of human-pathogen interaction. Yet, existing studies are limited in taxonomic scope, sensing of the phylogenetic signal, and resolution by largely analyzing genes independent of their organization in functional gene clusters. Here, we explored more than 3,000 Acinetobacter genomes in a phylogenomic framework integrating orthology-based phylogenetic profiling and microsynteny conservation analyses. We delineate gene clusters in the type strain A. baumannii ATCC 19606 whose evolutionary conservation indicates a functional integration of the subsumed genes. These evolutionarily stable gene clusters (ESGCs) reveal metabolic pathways, transcriptional regulators residing next to their targets but also tie together sub-clusters with distinct functions to form higher-order functional modules. We shortlisted 150 ESGCs that either co-emerged with the pathogenic ACB clade or are preferentially found therein. They provide a high-resolution picture of genetic and functional changes that coincide with the manifestation of the pathogenic phenotype in the ACB clade. Key innovations are the remodeling of the regulatory-effector cascade connecting LuxR/LuxI quorum sensing via an intermediate messenger to biofilm formation, the extension of micronutrient scavenging systems, and the increase of metabolic flexibility by exploiting carbon sources that are provided by the human host. We could show experimentally that only members of the ACB clade use kynurenine as a sole carbon and energy source, a substance produced by humans to fine-tune the antimicrobial innate immune response. In summary, this study provides a rich and unbiased set of novel testable hypotheses on how pathogenic Acinetobacter interact with and ultimately infect their human host. It is a comprehensive resource for future research into novel therapeutic strategies.	2022 Jun	Bardya Djahanschiri, Gisela Di Venanzio, Jesus S Distel, Jennifer Breisch, Marius Alfred Dieckmann, Alexander Goesmann, Beate Averhoff, Stephan Göttig, Gottfried Wilharm, Mario F Feldman, Ingo Ebersberger	PLoS Genet
36030268	Human serum albumin (HSA) regulates the expression of histone-like nucleoid structure protein (H-NS) in Acinetobacter baumannii.	According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Acinetobacter baumannii is listed among the most threatening pathogens. A. baumannii is mainly a nosocomial pathogen with a distinctive ability to survive in multiple environments. These characteristics together with this bacterium's ability to acquire antibiotic resistance determinants make it a notorious pathogen. The presence of human serum albumin (HSA) is associated with modification of expression levels in numerous genes. The presence of HSA in the culture medium is also correlated with a reduction in levels of the global suppressor histone-like nucleoid structure protein, H-NS. Comparative transcriptome analysis of the wild type and isogenic Δhns strains cultured in lysogeny broth (LB) in the presence or absence of HSA revealed that the expression of a subset of eleven genes are modified in the Δhns cultured in LB and the wild-type strain in the presence of HSA, pointing out these genes as candidates to be regulated by the presence of HSA through H-NS. Six and five of these genes were up- or down-regulated, respectively. Three of these genes have functions in quorum sensing (acdA, kar and fadD), one in quorum quenching (aidA), two in stress response (katE, ywrO), three in metabolism (phaC, yedL1, and yedL2), one in biofilm formation (csuAB), and one in β-oxidation of fatty acids (fadA). The regulation of these genes was assessed by: (i) transcriptional analysis and qPCR at the transcriptional level; and (ii) by determining the phenotypic characteristics of each function. The results of these studies support the hypothesis that HSA-mediated reduction of H-NS levels may be one very important regulatory circuit utilized by A. baumannii to adapt to selected environments, such as those where HSA-containing human fluids are abundant.	2022 Aug	Jenny Escalante, Brent Nishimura, Marisel R Tuttobene, Tomás Subils, Camila Pimentel, Nardin Georgeos, Rodrigo Sieira, Robert A Bonomo, Marcelo E Tolmasky, Maria Soledad Ramirez	Sci Rep
35618774	Immunosuppression broadens evolutionary pathways to drug resistance and treatment failure during Acinetobacter baumannii pneumonia in mice.	Acinetobacter baumannii is increasingly refractory to antibiotic treatment in healthcare settings. As is true of most human pathogens, the genetic path to antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and the role that the immune system plays in modulating AMR during disease are poorly understood. Here we reproduced several routes to fluoroquinolone resistance, performing evolution experiments using sequential lung infections in mice that are replete with or depleted of neutrophils, providing two key insights into the evolution of drug resistance. First, neutropenic hosts acted as reservoirs for the accumulation of drug resistance during drug treatment. Selection for variants with altered drug sensitivity profiles arose readily in the absence of neutrophils, while immunocompetent animals restricted the appearance of these variants. Secondly, antibiotic treatment failure in the immunocompromised host was shown to occur without clinically defined resistance, an unexpected result that provides a model for how antibiotic failure occurs clinically in the absence of AMR. The genetic mechanism underlying both these results is initiated by mutations activating the drug egress pump regulator AdeL, which drives persistence in the presence of antibiotic. Therefore, antibiotic persistence mutations present a two-pronged risk during disease, causing drug treatment failure in the immunocompromised host while simultaneously increasing the emergence of high-level AMR.	2022 Jun	Wenwen Huo, Lindsay M Busch, Juan Hernandez-Bird, Efrat Hamami, Christopher W Marshall, Edward Geisinger, Vaughn S Cooper, Tim van Opijnen, Jason W Rosch, Ralph R Isberg	Nat Microbiol
37158230	DksA is a conserved master regulator of stress response in Acinetobacter baumannii.	Coordination of bacterial stress response mechanisms is critical for long-term survival in harsh environments for successful host infection. The general and specific stress responses of well-studied Gram-negative pathogens like Escherichia coli are controlled by alternative sigma factors, archetypically RpoS. The deadly hospital pathogen Acinetobacter baumannii is notoriously resistant to environmental stresses, yet it lacks RpoS, and the molecular mechanisms driving this incredible stress tolerance remain poorly defined. Here, using functional genomics, we identified the transcriptional regulator DksA as a master regulator for broad stress protection and virulence in A. baumannii. Transcriptomics, phenomics and in vivo animal studies revealed that DksA controls ribosomal protein expression, metabolism, mutation rates, desiccation, antibiotic resistance, and host colonization in a niche-specific manner. Phylogenetically, DksA was highly conserved and well-distributed across Gammaproteobacteria, with 96.6% containing DksA, spanning 88 families. This study lays the groundwork for understanding DksA as a major regulator of general stress response and virulence in this important pathogen.	2023 May	Ram P Maharjan, Geraldine J Sullivan, Felise G Adams, Bhumika S Shah, Jane Hawkey, Natasha Delgado, Lucie Semenec, Hue Dinh, Liping Li, Francesca L Short, Julian Parkhill, Ian T Paulsen, Lars Barquist, Bart A Eijkelkamp, Amy K Cain	Nucleic Acids Res
36736497	Development mechanism of resistant population post-exposure to tigecycline in tigecycline-heteroresistant Acinetobacter baumannii strain.	Tigecycline heteroresistance is highly prevalent in Acinetobacter baumannii clinical isolates, reducing the efficacy of tigecycline treatment. This study investigated the population dynamics of A. baumannii with tigecycline heteroresistance to determine the origin of resistance that occurs over time after antibiotic exposure. Tigecycline heteroresistance was imitated by mixing tigecycline-susceptible and -resistant A. baumannii isolates in a 1:10<sup>-6</sup> ratio, and confirmed using population analysis profiling. Growth curves and an in-vitro competition assay found no difference in bacterial fitness between tigecycline-resistant and -susceptible populations. The green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression system and flow cytometry were used to monitor the population dynamics of the heteroresistant population, while differentiating the resistant population from the susceptible population. The mimicked tigecycline heteroresistance was confirmed to be reproducible and stable without tigecycline. The GFP-expressing population (i.e. the resistant population) nearly went undetected because it only represented approximately 10<sup>-6</sup> of the entire population. However, when the mimicked tigecycline-heteroresistant strain was treated with tigecycline, most subpopulations expressing GFP were detected. The surviving A. baumannii population, upon exposure to tigecycline, exhibited a high minimum inhibitory concentration for tigecycline, equivalent to that of tigecycline-resistant isolates that were used to mimic heteroresistance. These results indicate that the development of resistance in tigecycline-heteroresistant A. baumannii strains, resulting in decreased antibiotic efficacy, may depend on the selection of a pre-existing resistant subpopulation.	2023 Apr	Jeongwoo Jo, Wonbeom Park, Dae-Hyuk Kweon, Kwan Soo Ko	Int J Antimicrob Agents
36417622	Community-acquired Acinetobacter baumannii pneumonia: a rare case in Brazil.	Acinetobacter baumannii, a common pathogen in nosocomial infections, is a rare cause of community-acquired pneumonia. This report highlights the difficulties in its early diagnosis and effective treatment, as it is a multidrug-resistant microorganism with rapid, unfavorable progression. To better understand its clinical outcome, we searched the literature for similar cases but found no community-acquired cases in Brazil.	2022	Izadora Raduan Brigo, Leandro de Resende Yamamoto, Rodrigo Juliano Molina	Rev Soc Bras Med Trop
36830328	The RND Efflux Pump Gene Expression in the Biofilm Formation of <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>.	Multidrug resistant (MDR) <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> is a critical opportunistic pathogen in healthcare-associated infections (HAI). This is attributed to several factors, including its ability to develop biofilms that can enhance antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in addition to creating an environment for horizontal transfer of antibiotic resistance genes. The role of the efflux pump in biofilm formation is important for studies on alternative treatments for biofilms. One of the significant efflux pump families is the RND efflux pump family, which is common in Gram negative bacteria. The aim is to study the role of the RND efflux pump in biofilm formation by <i>A. baumannii</i>. The biofilm formation potential of thirty-four MDR <i>A. baumannii</i> isolates was evaluated by crystal violet assays. The effect of efflux pump inhibition and activation was studied using the efflux pump inhibitor carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) and the RND efflux pump substrate levofloxacin (at sub-MIC), respectively. The isolates were genotypically grouped by enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus (ERIC) typing and the expression of <i>adeABC</i>, <i>adeFGH</i>, and <i>adeIJK</i> efflux pump genes was measured by qPCR. Overall, 88.2% (30/34) of isolates were biofilm producers (the phenotype was variable including strong and weak producers). Efflux pump inhibition by CCCP reduced the biofilm formation significantly (<i>p</i> < 0.05) in 17.6% (6/34) of some isolates, whereas sub-MICs of the substrate levofloxacin increased biofilm formation in 20.5% (7/34) of other isolates. Overexpression of the three RND efflux pump genes was detected in five out of eleven selected isolates for qPCR with remarkable overexpression in the <i>adeJ</i> gene. No correlation was detected between the biofilm phenotype pattern and the RND efflux pump gene expression in biofilm cells relative to planktonic cells. In conclusion, the role of the RND efflux pumps AdeABC, AdeFGH, and AdeIJK in biofilm formation does not appear to be pivotal and the expression differs according to the genetic background of each strain. Thus, these pumps may not be a promising target for biofilm inhibition.	2023 Feb	Ola A Abd El-Rahman, Fatma Rasslan, Safaa S Hassan, Hossam M Ashour, Reham Wasfi	Antibiotics (Basel)
35875928	Charge effect of water-soluble porphyrin derivatives as a prototype to fight infections caused by <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> by aPDT approaches.	In the last decade<i>, Acinetobacter baumannii</i> has emerged as a pathogen associated with infections in intensive care units worldwide, especially due to its ability to resist an extensive list of antibiotics. In this context, porphyrins have emerged as an important strategy in photodynamic therapy, since they are a group of tetrapyrrolic compounds with important photochemical and photobiological activities. In this study, the antimicrobial photodynamic activity of <i>meso</i>-tetra(4-<i>N-methyl</i>-pyridyl)porphyrin (<b>H<sub>2</sub>TMePyP<sup>+</sup></b>) and <i>meso</i>-tetra(4-sulfonatophenyl)porphyrin (<b>H<sub>2</sub>TPPS<sup>‒</sup></b>) was evaluated against <i>A. baumannii</i> by minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), anti-biofilm activity, and the interaction with antibiotics after exposure to white-light LED irradiation. The cationic derivative <b>H<sub>2</sub>TMePyP<sup>+</sup></b> was more potent (MIC = 0.61 µM) than <b>H<sub>2</sub>TPPS<sup>‒</sup></b>, with anti-biofilm activity and increased the antimicrobial activity of ciprofloxacin and amikacin. Given these findings, the tetra-cationic porphyrins can be assumed as prototypes to optimize and develop new agents by promoting oxidative stress and inducing free radical production.	2022 Jul	Carolina da Silva Canielles Caprara, Livia da Silva Freitas, Bernardo Almeida Iglesias, Lara Beatriz Ferreira, Daniela Fernandes Ramos	Biofouling

36010006	In Vitro Activity of Sulbactam-Durlobactam against Carbapenem-Resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> Clinical Isolates: A Multicentre Report from Italy.	In the present study, the in vitro activity of the sulbactam-durlobactam (SUL-DUR) combination was evaluated against 141 carbapenem-resistant <i>A. baumannii</i> (CR<i>Ab</i>) clinical strains collected from six Italian laboratories. Over half (54.6%) of these isolates were resistant to colistin. The SUL-DUR combination was active against these CR<i>Ab</i> isolates with MIC<sub>50</sub> and MIC<sub>90</sub> values of 0.5 mg/L and 4 mg/L, respectively. Only eleven isolates were resistant to SUL-DUR with MIC values ranging from 8 to 128 mg/L. The SUL-DUR resistant <i>A. baumannii</i> exhibited several antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) such as <i>bla</i><sub>OXA-20</sub>, <i>bla</i><sub>OXA-58</sub>, <i>bla</i><sub>OXA-66</sub>, <i>bla</i><sub>ADC-25</sub>, <i>aac(6')-Ib3</i> and <i>aac(6')-Ib-cr</i> and mutations in <i>gyr</i>A (S81L) and <i>par</i>C (V104I, D105E). However, in these isolates, mutations Q488K and Y528H were found in PBP3. Different determinants were also identified in these CR<i>Ab</i> isolates, including <i>adeABC</i>, <i>adeFGH</i>, <i>adeIJK</i>, <i>abeS</i>, <i>abaQ</i> and <i>abaR</i>, which encode multidrug efflux pumps associated with resistance to multiple antibacterial agents. This is the first report on the antimicrobial activity of SUL-DUR against carbapenem-resistant <i>A. baumannii</i> isolates selected from multiple regions in Italy.	2022 Aug	Bernardetta Segatore, Alessandra Piccirilli, Sabrina Cherubini, Luigi Principe, Giovanni Alloggia, Maria Lina Mezzatesta, Mario Salmeri, Stefano Di Bella, Roberta Migliavacca, Aurora Piazza, Elisa Meroni, Paolo Fazii, Daniela Visaggio, Paolo Visca, Venere Cortazzo, Giulia De Angelis, Arianna Pompilio, Mariagrazia Perilli	Antibiotics (Basel)
37052656	Revealing the single-channel characteristics of OprD (OccAB1) porins from hospital strains of Acinetobacter baumannii.	Nowadays, reports of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) against many antibiotics are increasing because of their misapplication. With this rise, there is a serious decrease in the discovery and development of new types of antibiotics amid an increase in multi-drug resistance. Unfermented Acinetobacter baumannii from gram-negative bacteria, which is one of the main causes of nosocomial infections and multi-drug resistance, has 4 main kinds of antibiotic resistance mechanism: inactivating antibiotics by enzymes, reduced numbers of porins and changing of their target or cellular functions due to mutations, and efflux pumps. In this study, characterization of the possible mutations in OprD (OccAB1) porins from hospital strains of A. baumannii were investigated using single channel electrophysiology and compared with the standard OprD isolated from wild type ATCC 19,606. For this aim, 5 A. baumannii bacteria samples were obtained from patients infected with A. baumannii, after which OprD porins were isolated from these A. baumannii strains. OprD porins were then inserted in an artificial lipid bilayer and the current-voltage curves were obtained using electrical recordings through a pair of Ag/AgCl electrodes. We observed that each porin has a characteristic conductance and single channel recording, which then leads to differences in channel diameter. Finally, the single channel data have been compared with the gene sequences of each porin. It was interesting to find out that each porin isolated has a unique porin diameter and decreased anion selectivity compared to the wild type.	2023 Apr	Aliakbar Ebrahimi, Tuğçe Ergün, Özge Kaygusuz İzgördü, Cihan Darcan, Hüseyin Avci, Barçin Öztürk, Hatice Rahmet Güner, Hamed Ghorbanpoor, Fatma Doğan Güzel	Eur Biophys J
36475717	Penicillin Binding Protein 7/8 Is a Potential Drug Target in Carbapenem-Resistant Acinetobacter baumannii.	Limited therapeutic options dictate the need for new classes of antimicrobials active against carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii. Presented data confirm and extend penicillin binding protein 7/8 (PBP 7/8) as a high-value target in the CR A. baumannii strain HUMC1. PBP 7/8 was essential for optimal growth/survival of HUMC1 in <i>ex vivo</i> human ascites and in a rat subcutaneous abscess model; in a mouse pneumonia model, the absence of PBP 7/8 decreased lethality 11-fold. The loss of PBP 7/8 resulted in increased permeability, sensitivity to complement, and lysozyme-mediated bactericidal activity. These changes did not appear to be due to alterations in the cellular fatty acid composition or capsule production. However, a decrease in lipid A and an increase in coccoidal cells and cell aggregation were noted. The compromise of the stringent permeability barrier in the PBP 7/8 mutant was reflected by an increased susceptibility to several antimicrobials. Importantly, expression of <i>ampC</i> was not significantly affected by the loss of PBP 7/8 and serial passage of the mutant strain in human ascites over 7 days did not yield revertants possessing a wild-type phenotype. In summary, these data and other features support PBP 7/8 as a high-value drug target for extensively drug-resistant and CR A. baumannii. Our results guide next-stage studies; the determination that the inactivation of PBP 7/8 results in an increased sensitivity to lysozyme enables the design of a high-throughput screening assay to identify small molecule compounds that can specifically inhibit PBP 7/8 activity.	2023 Jan	Thomas A Russo, Ulrike Carlino-MacDonald, Cassandra L Alvarado, Connor J Davies, Oscar Barnes, Grishma Trivedi, Parijat Mathur, Alan Hutson, Felise G Adams, Maoge Zang, Alice Ascari, Bart A Eijkelkamp	Antimicrob Agents Chemother
36482013	Effect of biosynthesized selenium nanoparticles using Nepeta extract against multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii.	The problems of drug resistance in bacteria have become one of the daily challenges of the clinical treatment of patients, which inevitably forces us to use agents other than common antibiotics. Among these, we can take help from different properties and applications of nanoparticles (NPs). In this work, we evaluate the antibacterial activity of biosynthesized selenium nanoparticles (SeNPs) against standard strains of multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii. The production of biosynthesized SeNPs was proved by ultraviolet-visible, Fourier transform infrared, X-ray diffractometer, Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy, Dynamic light scattering, and Zeta potential methods. The cytotoxicity effect of SeNPs was investigated by MTT assay. Disk diffusion agar (DDA) and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) tests were performed on the mentioned bacteria using different classes of standard antibiotics and SeNPs separately. The impact of SeNPs combined with the desired antibiotics for better treatment of these infections was evaluated by checkerboard assay to determine the synergism effect. After the confirmation results based on the biosynthesis of SeNPs, both standard bacterial strains were susceptible to SeNPs and had a zone of inhibition using the DDA test. Also, the results of MICs showed that biosynthesized SeNPs in lower concentrations than antibiotics cause no growth of bacteria. On the other hand, according to the checkerboard assay, SeNPs had a synergistic effect with conventional antibiotics. The antibacterial sensitivity tests demonstrated the inhibition of bacterial growth in the presence of lower concentrations of SeNPs than common antibiotics. This property can be exerted in future applications to solve the drug resistance obstacle of microorganisms in bacterial diseases.	2023 Feb	Shadi Zeraatkar, Maedeh Tahan, Hamid Sadeghian, Razieh Nazari, Mostafa Behmadi, Mahdi Hosseini Bafghi	J Basic Microbiol
36506188	Lectin-Fortified Cationic Copper Sulfide Nanoparticles Gain Dual Targeting Capabilities to Treat Carbapenem-Resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> Infection.	Targeted drug delivery maximizes the chance to combat infection caused by drug-resistant pathogens. Herein, lectin-fortified cationic copper sulfide (cCuS) nanoparticles were suggested for targeted adhesion to bacterial membranes and to enforce bacterial death. Jacalin, a lectin from jackfruit seed, was conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), and its ability to recognize bacterial cell surface glycans was demonstrated. Jacalin formed a noncovalent complex with cCuS, which was investigated by fluorescence quenching measurements. The data revealed that jacalin-cCuS (JcCuS) had a good affinity with an association constant <i>K</i> <sub>a</sub> of 2.27 (± 0.28) × 10<sup>4</sup> M<sup>-1</sup>. The resultant JcCuS complex displayed excellent anti-infective activity against carbapenem-resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> (CRAB). The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of cCuS was 62.5 μM, which was 2-fold lower than that of the broad-spectrum antibiotic ciprofloxacin. Interestingly, the MIC of JcCuS was reduced to 15.63 μM, which was attributed to jacalin fortification. The mechanistic study unveiled that JcCuS affected the membrane integrity, depolarized the inner membrane, and produced excess reactive oxygen species to combat CRAB at a lower concentration compared to cCuS. <i>A. baumannii</i> formed a biofilm more readily, which played a critical role in pathogenesis and resistance in clinical settings. JcCuS (3.91 μM) displayed stronger antibiofilm activity without affecting the metabolic viability of CRAB. Microscopy analyses confirmed the inhibition of biofilm formation and disruption of the mature biofilm upon treatment with JcCuS. Furthermore, JcCuS hindered pellicle formation and inhibited the biofilm-associated virulence factor of CRAB such as exopolysaccharide, cell surface hydrophobicity, swarming, and twitching mobility. The anti-infective potential of JcCuS was demonstrated by rescuing CRAB-infected zebrafish. The reduction in pathogen proliferation in muscle tissues was observed in the treated group, and the fish recovered from the infection and was restored to normal life within 12 h. The findings illustrate that lectin fortification offers a unique advantage in enhancing the therapeutic potential of antimicrobials against human pathogens of critical priority worldwide.	2022 Dec	Dharshini Karnan Singaravelu, Dalal Nasser Binjawhar, Fuad Ameen, Anbazhagan Veerappan	ACS Omega
36073931	Mechanisms of IS<i>26</i>-Mediated Amplification of the <i>aphA1</i> Gene Leading to Tobramycin Resistance in an Acinetobacter baumannii Isolate.	Enhanced levels of resistance to antibiotics arising from amplification of an antibiotic resistance gene that impact therapeutic options are increasingly observed. Amplification can also disclose novel phenotypes leading to treatment failure. However, the mechanism is poorly understood. Here, the route to amplification of the <i>aphA1</i> kanamycin and neomycin resistance gene during tobramycin treatment of an Acinetobacter baumannii clinical isolate, leading to tobramycin resistance and treatment failure, was investigated. In the tobramycin-susceptible parent isolate, MRSN56, a single copy of <i>aphA1</i> is present in the pseudocompound transposon PTn<i>6020</i>, bounded by directly oriented copies of IS<i>26</i>. For two clinical resistant isolates, new long-read sequence data were combined with available short-read data to complete the genomes. Comparison to the completed genome of MRSN56 revealed that, in both cases, IS<i>26</i> had generated a circular translocatable unit (TU) containing PTn<i>6020</i> and additional adjacent DNA. In one case, this TU was reincorporated into the second product generated by the deletion that formed the TU via the targeted conservative route and amplified about 7 times. In the second case, the TU was incorporated at a new location via the copy-in route and amplified about 65 times. Experimental amplification <i>ex vivo</i> by subjecting MRSN56 to tobramycin selection pressure yielded different TUs, which were incorporated at either the original location or a new location and amplified many times. The outcomes suggest that when IS<i>26</i> is involved, amplification occurs via rolling circle replication of a newly formed TU coupled to the IS<i>26</i>-mediated TU formation or reincorporation step. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Heteroresistance, a significant issue that is known to impact antibiotic treatment outcomes, is caused by the presence of spontaneously arising cells with elevated levels of resistance to therapeutically important antibiotics in a population of susceptible cells. Gene amplification is one well-documented cause of heteroresistance, but precisely how extensive amplification occurs is not understood. Here, we establish the case for the direct involvement of IS<i>26</i> activity in the amplification of the <i>aphA1</i> gene to disclose resistance to tobramycin. The <i>aphA1</i> gene is usually found associated with IS<i>26</i> in Gram-negative pathogens and is commonly found in extensively resistant Acinetobacter baumannii strains. IS<i>26</i> and related IS cause adjacent deletions, forming a nonreplicating circular molecule known as a translocatable unit (TU), and amplification via a rolling circle mechanism appears to be coupled to either IS<i>26</i>-mediated TU formation or reincorporation. Related IS found in Gram-positive pathogens may play a similar role.	2022 Oct	Christopher J Harmer, Francois Lebreton, Jason Stam, Patrick T McGann, Ruth M Hall	Microbiol Spectr
36671325	Use of High-Dose Nebulized Colistimethate in Patients with Colistin-Only Susceptible <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> VAP: Clinical, Pharmacokinetic and Microbiome Features.	(1) Background: Colistin-only susceptible (COS) <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> (AB) ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) represents a clinical challenge in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) due to the negligible lung diffusion of this molecule and the low-grade evidence on efficacy of its nebulization. (2) Methods: We conducted a prospective observational study on 134 ICU patients with COS-AB VAP to describe the 'real life' clinical use of high-dose (5 MIU q8) aerosolized colistin, using a vibrating mesh nebulizer. Lung pharmacokinetics and microbiome features were investigated. (3) Results: Patients were enrolled during the COVID-19 pandemic with the ICU presenting a SAPS II of 42 [32-57]. At VAP diagnosis, the median PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub> was 120 [100-164], 40.3% were in septic shock, and 24.6% had secondary bacteremia. The twenty-eight day mortality was 50.7% with 60.4% and 40.3% rates of clinical cure and microbiological eradication, respectively. We did not observe any drug-related adverse events. Epithelial lining fluid colistin concentrations were far above the CRAB minimal-inhibitory concentration and the duration of nebulized therapy was an independent predictor of microbiological eradication (12 [9.75-14] vs. 7 [4-13] days, OR (95% CI): 1.069 (1.003-1.138), <i>p</i> = 0.039). (4) Conclusions: High-dose and prolonged colistin nebulization, using a vibrating mesh, was a safe adjunctive therapeutic strategy for COS-AB VAP. Its right place and efficacy in this setting warrant investigation in interventional studies.	2023 Jan	Gennaro De Pascale, Gabriele Pintaudi, Lucia Lisi, Flavio De Maio, Salvatore Lucio Cutuli, Eloisa Sofia Tanzarella, Simone Carelli, Gianmarco Lombardi, Melania Cesarano, Veronica Gennenzi, Gabriella Maria Pia Ciotti, Domenico Luca Grieco, Brunella Posteraro, Maurizio Sanguinetti, Pierluigi Navarra, Massimo Antonelli	Antibiotics (Basel)
36787358	A conserved zinc-binding site in <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> PBP2 required for elongasome-directed bacterial cell shape.	<i>Acinetobacter</i> <i>baumannii</i> is a gram-negative bacterial pathogen that causes challenging nosocomial infections. β-lactam targeting of penicillin-binding protein (PBP)-mediated cell wall peptidoglycan (PG) formation is a well-established antimicrobial strategy. Exposure to carbapenems or zinc (Zn)-deprived growth conditions leads to a rod-to-sphere morphological transition in <i>A. baumannii</i>, an effect resembling that caused by deficiency in the RodA-PBP2 PG synthesis complex required for cell wall elongation. While it is recognized that carbapenems preferentially acylate PBP2 in <i>A. baumannii</i> and therefore block the transpeptidase function of the RodA-PBP2 system, the molecular details underpinning cell wall elongation inhibition upon Zn starvation remain undefined. Here, we report the X-ray crystal structure of <i>A. baumannii</i> PBP2, revealing an unexpected Zn coordination site in the transpeptidase domain required for protein stability. Mutations in the Zn-binding site of PBP2 cause a loss of bacterial rod shape and increase susceptibility to β-lactams, therefore providing a direct rationale for cell wall shape maintenance and Zn homeostasis in <i>A. baumannii</i>. Furthermore, the Zn-coordinating residues are conserved in various β- and γ-proteobacterial PBP2 orthologs, consistent with a widespread Zn-binding requirement for function that has been previously unknown. Due to the emergence of resistance to virtually all marketed antibiotic classes, alternative or complementary antimicrobial strategies need to be explored. These findings offer a perspective for dual inhibition of Zn-dependent PG synthases and metallo-β-lactamases by metal chelating agents, considered the most sought-after adjuvants to restore β-lactam potency against gram-negative bacteria.	2023 Feb	Carmina Micelli, Yunfei Dai, Nicole Raustad, Ralph R Isberg, Christopher G Dowson, Adrian J Lloyd, Edward Geisinger, Allister Crow, David I Roper	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A

37111736	Characterization of Increased Extracellular Vesicle-Mediated Tigecycline Resistance in <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>.	Carbapenem-resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> (CRAB) is the most detrimental pathogen that causes hospital-acquired infections. Tigecycline (TIG) is currently used as a potent antibiotic for treating CRAB infections; however, its overuse substantially induces the development of resistant isolates. Some molecular aspects of the resistance mechanisms of AB to TIG have been reported, but they are expected to be far more complicated and diverse than what has been characterized thus far. In this study, we identified bacterial extracellular vesicles (EVs), which are nano-sized lipid-bilayered spherical structures, as mediators of TIG resistance. Using laboratory-made TIG-resistant AB (TIG-R AB), we demonstrated that TIG-R AB produced more EVs than control TIG-susceptible AB (TIG-S AB). Transfer analysis of TIG-R AB-derived EVs treated with proteinase or DNase to recipient TIG-S AB showed that TIG-R EV proteins are major factors in TIG resistance transfer. Additional transfer spectrum analysis demonstrated that EV-mediated TIG resistance was selectively transferred to <i>Escherichia coli</i>, <i>Salmonella typhimurium</i>, and <i>Proteus mirabilis</i>. However, this action was not observed in <i>Klebsiella pneumonia</i> and <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>. Finally, we showed that EVs are more likely to induce TIG resistance than antibiotics. Our data provide direct evidence that EVs are potent cell-derived components with a high, selective occurrence of TIG resistance in neighboring bacterial cells.	2023 Apr	Hyejin Cho, Tesalonika Sondak, Kwang-Sun Kim	Pharmaceutics
34375286	Structure Based in Silico Screening Revealed a Potent Acinetobacter Baumannii Ftsz Inhibitor From Asinex Antibacterial Library.	The superbug Acinetobacter baumannii is an increasingly prevalent pathogen of the intensive care units where its treatment is challenging. The identification of newer drug targets and the development of propitious therapeutics against this pathogen is of utmost importance. A drug target, cell division enzyme (FtsZ), involved in A. baumannii cytokinesis is a promising avenue for antibacterial therapy. Structure based virtual screening illustrated a lead-like molecule from Asinex antibacterial library to have the best binding affinity for the FtsZ active pocket. Computational pharmacokinetics predicted the compound to have the safest pharmacokinetics profile, thus maximizing the chances of the molecule reaching the market with enhanced efficacy and lesser toxicity. Molecular dynamics simulations in an aqueous environment revealed the flexibility of protein loop regions, and upward extension followed by the backward movement of the inhibitor N, N-dimethylpyridazin-3-amine ring on its axis. The active pocket residue Thr310 demonstrated to play significant role in inhibitor binding. The binding free energy predicted by MM/GBSA and MM/PBSA reflected system stability with a total value of -62.15 kcal/mol and -10.60 kcal/mol, respectively. The absolute binding free energy estimated by WaterSwap was -16 kcal/mol that validates and affirms complex stability. The inhibitor represents a promising scaffold as a lead optimization for the FtsZ enzyme.	2022	Afifa Navid, Sajjad Ahmad, Rida Sajjad, Saad Raza, Syed Sikander Azam	IEEE/ACM Trans Comput Biol Bioinform

37212653	Contribution of Iron-Transport Systems and β-Lactamases to Cefiderocol Resistance in Clinical Isolates of Acinetobacter baumannii Endemic to New York City.	The development of resistance to cefiderocol among multidrug resistant Acinetobacter baumannii has been attributed to downregulation in iron transport systems and a variety of β-lactamases. However, the precise contribution of each in clinical isolates remains to be determined. Sixteen clinical isolates with varying degrees of cefiderocol resistance were investigated. Susceptibility testing was performed with and without the presence of iron and avibactam. Expression of 10 iron transport systems and <i>bla</i><sub>ADC</sub> and <i>bla</i><sub>OXA-51-type</sub> were analyzed by real time RT-PCR. The acquisition of a variety of β-lactamases was also determined. In 2 isolates the impact of silencing the <i>bla</i><sub>ADC</sub> gene was achieved using a target specific group II intron. For most resistant isolates, MICS for cefiderocol were similar with or without the presence of iron, and there was an overall decrease in expression of receptors (including <i>pirA</i> and <i>piuA</i>) involved in ferric uptake. However, expression of the ferrous uptake system (<i>faoA</i>) persisted. The addition of avibactam (4 μg/mL) lowered most cefiderocol MICs to 2 to 4 μg/mL. Most isolates possessed ADC-25 or ADC-33. Cefiderocol resistance correlated with over-expression of <i>bla</i><sub>ADC</sub>; silencing of this β-lactamase resulted in a ≥ 8-fold decrease in cefiderocol MICs. Over-expression of specific <i>bla</i><sub>ADC</sub> subtypes, in a background of generalized repression of ferric uptake systems, were consistent features in clinical isolates of cefiderocol-resistant <i>A. baumannii</i>.	2023 May	Habtamu Asrat, Jevon Samaroo-Campbell, Subhan Ata, John Quale	Antimicrob Agents Chemother
37065616	<i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> adaptation to the host pH microenvironment is mediated by allelic variation in a single residue of BauA protein.	<i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> has been listed as one of the most critical pathogens in nosocomial infections; however, the key genes and mechanisms to adapt to the host microenvironment lack in-depth understanding. In this study, a total of 76 isolates (from 8 to 12 isolates per patient, spanning 128 to 188 days) were longitudinally collected from eight patients to investigate the within-host evolution of <i>A. baumannii</i>. A total of 70 within-host mutations were identified, 80% of which were nonsynonymous, indicating the important role of positive selection. Several evolutionary strategies of <i>A. baumannii</i> to increase its potential to adapt to the host microenvironment were identified, including hypermutation and recombination. Six genes were mutated in isolates from two or more patients, including two TonB-dependent receptor genes (<i>bauA</i> and <i>BJAB07104_RS00665</i>). In particular, the siderophore receptor gene <i>bauA</i> was mutated in multiple isolates from four patients with three MLST types, and all mutations were at amino acid 391 in ligand-binding sites. With 391T or 391A, BauA was more strongly bound to siderophores, which promoted the iron-absorption activity of <i>A. baumannii</i> at acidic or neutral pH, respectively. Through the A/T mutation at site 391 of BauA, <i>A. baumannii</i> displayed two reversible phases to adapt to distinct pH microenvironments. In conclusion, we demonstrated the comprehensive within-host evolutionary dynamics of <i>A. baumannii</i>, and discovered a key mutation of BauA site 391 as a genetic switch to adapt to different pH values, which may represent a model in the pathogen evolutionary adaption of the host microenvironment.	2023 Apr	Tao Li, Deyan Luo, Nianzhi Ning, Xiong Liu, Fanghong Chen, Liangyan Zhang, Chunmei Bao, Zhan Li, Deyu Li, Hongjing Gu, Fen Qu, Xiaolan Yang, Yanyu Huang, Boan Li, Hui Wang	PNAS Nexus
37023677	Dimeric 2-aminoimidazoles are highly active adjuvants for gram-positive selective antibiotics against Acinetobacter baumannii.	The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that hospital acquired infections have increased by 65% since 2019. One of the main contributors is the gram-negative bacterium Acinetobacter baumannii. Previously, we reported aryl 2-aminoimidazole (2-AI) adjuvants that potentiate macrolide antibiotics against A. baumannii. Macrolide antibiotics are typically used to treat infections caused by gram-positive bacteria, but are ineffective against most gram-negative bacteria. We describe a new class of dimeric 2-AIs that are highly active macrolide adjuvants, with lead compounds lowering minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) to or below the gram-positive breakpoint level against A. baumannii. The parent dimer lowers the clarithromycin (CLR) MIC against A. baumannii 5075 from 32 μg/mL to 1 μg/mL at 7.5 μM (3.4 μg/mL), and a subsequent structure activity relationship (SAR) study identified several compounds with increased activity. The lead compound lowers the CLR MIC to 2 μg/mL at 1.5 μM (0.72 μg/mL), far exceeding the activity of both the parent dimer and the previous lead aryl 2-AI. Furthermore, these dimeric 2-AIs exhibit considerably reduced mammalian cell toxicity compared to aryl-2AI adjuvants, with IC<sub>50</sub>s of the two lead compounds against HepG2 cells of >200 μg/mL, giving therapeutic indices of >250.	2023 May	Santiana A Marrujo, Veronica B Hubble, Jingdong Yang, Man Wang, Ansley M Nemeth, Samantha L Barlock, Dane Juarez, Richard D Smith, Roberta J Melander, Robert K Ernst, Mayland Chang, Christian Melander	Eur J Med Chem
35785672	Immunoprotective characterization of egg yolk immunoglobulin raised to loop 3 of outer membrane protein 34 (Omp34) in a murine model against Acinetobacter baumannii.	Acinetobacter baumannii is one of the most notorious nosocomial pathogens with high mortality rates. Recently, egg yolk antibody (IgY), has been considered as a promising biomolecule against pneumonia caused by this bacterium. Loop 3 of outer membrane protein 34 (Omp34) was predicted as a highly exposed immunogenic peptide. However, its immunogenicity remains to be experimentally elucidated. In the current study, a construct composed of 5 copies of loop3 of Omp34 labeled as Omp34L3X5 was designed. This construct as well as the recombinant Omp34 were expressed, purified, and injected into laying hens to raise specific antibodies. The specific IgYs were extracted from hyperimmune egg yolks. The Omp34L3X5 and whole cells (WC) of A. baumannii served as antigens in indirect ELISA to assess the purified IgYs reactivity. These antibodies were administered to neutropenic mice 1 h before the challenge with 10 × LD<sub>50</sub> of a clinical isolate of A. baumannii. The specific IgYs recognized recombinant Omp34 (P < 0.0001) as well as WC of A. baumannii (P < 0.05). The survival rate of mice that received anti- Omp34L3X5 or anti-Omp34 IgYs was 83.33 % and 100 % respectively. All control mice died within 24 h while mice that received non-specific IgYs died within 72 h. After 24 h, bacterial load in the lung of mice received non-specific IgYs, anti-Omp34L3X5 or anti-Omp34 IgYs were 2.03 × 10<sup>8</sup>, 2.2 × 10<sup>8</sup>, and 1.93 × 10<sup>8</sup> CFU/organ respectively. Bacterial load in the spleen of mice received non-specific IgYs, anti-Omp34L3X5 or anti-Omp34 IgYs were 1.03 × 10<sup>8</sup>, 7.8 × 10<sup>7</sup>, and 6.3 × 10<sup>7</sup> CFU/organ respectively. Bacterial load in lung and spleen of control mice were 3.03 × 10<sup>9</sup> and 1.45 × 10<sup>8</sup> CFU/organ respectively.	2022 Sep	Maryam Mesbahi Moghaddam, Iraj Rasooli, Mohammad Hossein Ghaini, Abolfazl Jahangiri, Fatemeh Ramezanalizadeh, Rasoul Ghasemkhah Tootkleh	Mol Immunol
36837545	Prediction of Putative Epitope Peptides against BaeR Associated with TCS Adaptation in <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> Using an In Silico Approach.	<i>Background and Objectives</i>: The BaeR protein is involved in the adaptation system of <i>A. baumannii</i> and is associated with virulence factors responsible for systemic infections in hospitalized patients. This study was conducted to characterize putative epitope peptides for the design of vaccines against BaeR protein, using an immune-informatic approach. <i>Materials and Methods</i>: FASTA sequences of BaeR from five different strains of <i>A. baumannii</i> were retrieved from the UNIPROT database and evaluated for their antigenicity, allergenicity and vaccine properties using BepiPred, Vaxijen, AlgPred, AntigenPro and SolPro. Their physio-chemical properties were assessed using the Expasy Protparam server. Immuno-dominant B-cell and T-cell epitope peptides were predicted using the IEDB database and MHC cluster server with a final assessment of their interactions with TLR-2. Results: A final selection of two peptide sequences (36aa and 22aa) was made from the 38 antigenic peptides. E1 was considered a soluble, non-allergenic antigen, and possessed negative GRAVY values, substantiating the hydrophilic nature of the proteins. Further analysis on the T-cell epitopes, class I immunogenicity and HLA allele frequencies yielded T-cell immuno-dominant peptides. The protein-peptide interactions of the TLR-2 receptor showed good similarity scores in terms of the high number of hydrogen bonds compared to other protein-peptide interactions. <i>Conclusions</i>: The two epitopes predicted from <i>BaeR</i> in the present investigation are promising vaccine candidates for targeting the TCS of <i>A. baumannii</i> in systemic and nosocomial infections. This study also demonstrates an alternative strategy to tackling and mitigating MDR strains of <i>A. baumannii</i> and provides a useful reference for the design and construction of novel vaccine candidates against this bacteria.	2023 Feb	A S Smiline Girija, Shoba Gunasekaran, Saman Habib, Mohammed Aljeldah, Basim R Al Shammari, Ahmad A Alshehri, Ameen S S Alwashmi, Safaa A Turkistani, Abdulsalam Alawfi, Amer Alshengeti, Mohammed Garout, Sara Alwarthan, Roua A Alsubki, Nouran M Moustafa, Ali A Rabaan	Medicina (Kaunas)
36704122	Stochastic activation of a family of TetR type transcriptional regulators controls phenotypic heterogeneity in <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>.	Phenotypic heterogeneity is an important mechanism for regulating bacterial virulence, where a single regulatory switch is typically activated to generate virulent and avirulent subpopulations. The opportunistic pathogen <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> can transition at high frequency between virulent opaque (VIR-O) and avirulent translucent subpopulations, distinguished by cells that form opaque or translucent colonies. We demonstrate that expression of 11 TetR-type transcriptional regulators (TTTRs) can drive cells from the VIR-O opaque subpopulation to cells that form translucent colonies. Remarkably, in a subpopulation of VIR-O cells, four of these TTTRs were stochastically activated in different combinations to drive cells to the translucent state. The resulting translucent subvariants exhibited unique phenotypic differences and the majority were avirulent. Due to their functional redundancy, a quadruple mutant with all four of these TTTRs inactivated was required to observe a loss of switching from the VIR-O state. Further, we demonstrate a small RNA, SrvS, acts as a "rheostat," where the levels of SrvS expression influences both the VIR-O to translucent switching frequency, and which TTTR is activated when VIR-O cells switch. In summary, this work has revealed a new paradigm for phenotypic switching in bacteria, where an unprecedented number of related transcriptional regulators are activated in different combinations to control virulence and generate unique translucent subvariants with distinct phenotypic properties.	2022 Nov	María Pérez-Varela, Aimee R P Tierney, Emma Dawson, Anna R Hutcheson, Kyle A Tipton, Sarah E Anderson, Marina E Haldopoulos, Shaina Song, Brooke R Tomlinson, Lindsey N Shaw, David S Weiss, Minsu Kim, Philip N Rather	PNAS Nexus
36951563	The COVID-19 Pandemic Sparked Off a Large-Scale Outbreak of Carbapenem-Resistant Acinetobacter baumannii from the Endemic Strains at an Italian Hospital.	Acinetobacter baumannii is a nosocomial pathogen that poses a serious threat due to the rise of incidence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains. During the COVID-19 pandemic, MDR A. baumannii clones have caused several outbreaks worldwide. Here, we describe a detailed investigation of an MDR A. baumannii outbreak that occurred at Policlinico San Matteo (Pavia, Italy). A total of 96 A. baumannii strains, isolated between January and July 2020 from 41 inpatients (both SARS-CoV-2 positive and negative) in different wards, were characterized by phenotypic and genomic analyses combining Illumina and Nanopore sequencing. Antibiotic susceptibility testing revealed that all isolates were resistant to carbapenems, and the sequence analysis attributed this to the carbapenemase gene <i>bla</i><sub>OXA-23</sub>. Virulence factor screening unveiled that all strains carried determinants for biofilm formation, while plasmid analysis revealed the presence of two plasmids, one of which was ~100 kbp long and encoded a phage sequence. A core genome-based phylogeny was inferred to integrate outbreak strain genomes with background genomes from public databases and the local surveillance program. All strains belonged to the globally disseminated sequence type 2 (ST2) clone and were mainly divided into two clades. Isolates from the outbreak clustered with surveillance isolates from 2019, suggesting that the outbreak was caused by two strains that were already circulating in the hospital before the start of the pandemic. The intensive spread of A. baumannii in the hospital was enhanced by the extreme emergency situation of the first COVID-19 pandemic wave that resulted in reduced attention to infection prevention and control practices. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> The COVID-19 pandemic, especially during the first wave, posed a great challenge to the hospital management and generally promoted nosocomial pathogen dissemination. MDR A. baumannii can easily spread and persist for a long time on surfaces, causing outbreaks in health care settings. Infection prevention and control practices, epidemiological surveillance, and microbiological screening are fundamental in order to control such outbreaks. Here, we sequenced the genomes of 96 isolates from an outbreak of MDR A. baumannii strains using both short- and long-read technology in order to reconstruct the outbreak events in fine detail. The sequence data demonstrated that two endemic clones of MDR A. baumannii were the source of this large hospital outbreak during the first COVID-19 pandemic wave, confirming the effect of COVID-19 emergency disrupting the protection provided by the use of the standard prevention procedures.	2023 Mar	Greta Petazzoni, Greta Bellinzona, Cristina Merla, Marta Corbella, Vincenzina Monzillo, Ørjan Samuelsen, Jukka Corander, Davide Sassera, Stefano Gaiarsa, Patrizia Cambieri	Microbiol Spectr

36905566	Enhanced bacterial killing with a combination of sulbactam/minocycline against dual carbapenemase-producing Acinetobacter baumannii.	Carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB) is often difficult to treat. Considering the current circumstances, there is an unquestionable need for new therapeutic options to treat CRAB infections. In the present study, the synergistic activity of sulbactam-based combination was determined against genetically characterized CRAB isolates. Non-duplicate CRAB isolates (n = 150) recovered from blood culture and endotracheal aspirates were included in this study. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of tetracyclines (minocycline, tigecycline, eravacycline) and their comparators (meropenem, sulbactam, cefoperazone/sulbactam, ceftazidime/avibactam, and colistin) were determined using the microbroth dilution method. Six isolates were tested for the synergistic activity of various sulbactam-based combinations using time-kill experiments. Tigecycline and minocycline showed a wide spread of MICs with most isolates in the range of 1 to 16 mg/L. The MIC<sub>90</sub> of eravacycline (0.5 mg/L) was four dilutions lower than that of tigecycline (8 mg/L). Minocycline with sulbactam was the most active dual combination against OXA-23 like (n = 2) and NDM with OXA-23 like producers (n = 1), which resulted in ≥ 2 log<sub>10</sub> kill. The combination of ceftazidime-avibactam with sulbactam showed ≥ 3 log<sub>10</sub> kill against all the three tested OXA-23 like producing CRAB isolates, but showed no activity against dual carbapenemase producers. Sulbactam with meropenem showed ≥ 2 log<sub>10</sub> kill against one OXA-23 like producing CRAB isolate. The findings suggest that sulbactam-based combination may confer therapeutic benefits against CRAB infections.	2023 May	Suriya Chandran, Yuvasri Manokaran, Saranya Vijayakumar, Baby Abirami Shankar, Yamuna Devi Bakthavatchalam, Hariharan Triplicane Dwarakanathan, Binesh Lal Yesudason, Balaji Veeraraghavan	Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis
37082186	The novel two-component system AmsSR governs alternative metabolic pathway usage in <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>.	In this study, we identify a novel two-component system in <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> (herein named AmsSR for regulator of alternative metabolic systems) only present in select gammaproteobacterial and betaproteobacterial species. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that the histidine kinase, AmsS, contains 14 predicted N-terminal transmembrane domains and harbors a hybrid histidine kinase arrangement in its C-terminus. Transcriptional analysis revealed the proton ionophore CCCP selectively induces P <i><sub>amsSR</sub></i> expression. Disruption of <i>amsSR</i> resulted in decreased intracellular pH and increased depolarization of cytoplasmic membranes. Transcriptome profiling revealed a major reordering of metabolic circuits upon <i>amsR</i> disruption, with energy generation pathways typically used by bacteria growing in limited oxygen being favored. Interestingly, we observed enhanced growth rates for mutant strains in the presence of glucose, which led to overproduction of pyruvate. To mitigate the toxic effects of carbon overflow, we noted acetate overproduction in <i>amsSR</i>-null strains, resulting from a hyperactive Pta-AckA pathway. Additionally, due to altered expression of key metabolic genes, <i>amsSR</i> mutants favor an incomplete TCA cycle, relying heavily on an overactive glyoxylate shunt. This metabolic reordering overproduces NADH, which is not oxidized by the ETC; components of which were significantly downregulated upon <i>amsSR</i> disruption. As a result, the mutants almost exclusively rely on substrate phosphorylation for ATP production, and consequently display reduced oxygen consumption in the presence of glucose. Collectively, our data suggests that disruption of <i>amsSR</i> affects the function of the aerobic respiratory chain, impacting the energy status of the cell, which in turn upregulates alternative metabolic and energy generation pathways.	2023	Leila G Casella, Nathanial J Torres, Brooke R Tomlinson, Mark Shepherd, Lindsey N Shaw	Front Microbiol
37074187	Collateral Changes in Cell Physiology Associated with ADC-7 β-Lactamase Expression in Acinetobacter baumannii.	The ADC (AmpC) β-lactamase is universally present in the Acinetobacter baumannii chromosome, suggesting it may have a yet-to-be-identified cellular function. Using peptidoglycan composition analysis, we show that overexpressing the ADC-7 β-lactamase in A. baumannii drives changes consistent with altered l,d-transpeptidase activity. Based on this, we tested whether cells overexpressing ADC-7 would exhibit new vulnerabilities. As proof of principle, a screen of transposon insertions revealed that an insertion in the distal 3' end of <i>canB</i>, encoding carbonic anhydrase, resulted in a significant loss of viability when the <i>adc-7</i> gene was overexpressed. A <i>canB</i> deletion mutant exhibited a more pronounced loss of viability than the transposon insertion, and this became amplified when cells overexpressed ADC-7. Interestingly, overexpression of the OXA-23 or TEM-1 β-lactamases also led to a pronounced loss of viability in cells with reduced carbonic anhydrase activity. In addition, we demonstrate that reduced CanB activity led to increased sensitivity to peptidoglycan synthesis inhibitors and to the carbonic anhydrase inhibitor ethoxzolamide. Furthermore, this strain exhibited a synergistic interaction with the peptidoglycan inhibitor fosfomycin and ethoxzolamide. Our results highlight the impact of ADC-7 overexpression on cell physiology and reveal that the essential carbonic anhydrase CanB may represent a novel target for antimicrobial agents that would exhibit increased potency against β-lactamase-overexpressing A. baumannii. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Acinetobacter baumannii has become resistant to all classes of antibiotics, with β-lactam resistance responsible for the majority of treatment failures. New classes of antimicrobials are needed to treat this high-priority pathogen. This study had uncovered a new genetic vulnerability in β-lactamase-expressing A. baumannii, where reduced carbonic anhydrase activity becomes lethal. Inhibitors of carbonic anhydrase could represent a new method for treating A. baumannii infections.	2023 Apr	Jennifer M Colquhoun, Marjan Farokhyfar, Alexander C Anderson, Christopher R Bethel, Robert A Bonomo, Anthony J Clarke, Philip N Rather	Microbiol Spectr
36695669	Resveratrol-Loaded Dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine Liposomal Large Porous Microparticle Inhalations for the Treatment of Bacterial Pneumonia Caused by <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>.	<b><i>Background:</i></b> <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>-mediated bacterial pneumonia is a common disease that is harmful to human health. Dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) is the major lipid component of the pulmonary surfactant (PS) found in the alveolar space; the PS helps to keep surface tension low, which allows for improved oxygen delivery. Resveratrol (RE) is a phytoalexin found in plants that is released in response to injury or infection. The therapeutic effect of Re is limited due to its low solubility and bioavailability. In this study, we report pulmonary delivery of Re-loaded DPPC liposomal large porous microparticles (RDLPMs) for treatment of <i>A. baumannii</i>-induced pneumonia. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> Novel RDLPMs were prepared by rotary evaporation and a freeze-drying method in this study. RDLPMs were evaluated by the particle size, electric potential, <i>in vitro</i> release, and particle size distribution. A rat model of <i>A. baumannii</i>-mediated pneumonia was established and used for pharmacodynamic evaluations. <b><i>Results:</i></b> The Re-loaded DPPC liposomes (RDLs) consisted of Re/DPPC (1:3, mol/mol) and DPPC/cholesterol (3:1, w/w), with a hydration time of 15 minutes. The RDLs had a high encapsulation efficiency of 69.8% ± 1.6%, a mean size of 191.5 ± 4.5 nm, and a high zeta potential of 12.4 ± 1.5 mV. The RDLPMs were composed of mannitol/large porous microparticles/RDLs (1:4:2, w/w/w) and had a loading efficiency of 2.20% ± 0.24%. The RDLPMs had an aerodynamic diameter (2.73 ± 0.65 μm), a good fluidity (28.30° ± 6.13°), and demonstrated high lung deposition (fine particle fraction = 43.33%). Surprisingly, while penicillin showed better microbial inhibition than the RDLPMs and Re groups <i>in vitro</i>, the RDLPMs were more effective <i>in vivo</i>. <b><i>Conclusion:</i></b> The RDLPMs showed good powder properties for pulmonary delivery. The RDLPMs may inhibit the nuclear factor kappa-B pathway and downregulate the expression of cytokines downstream of tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-1β. As well as, RDLPMs demonstrated some antibacterial properties against <i>A. baumannii</i> bacteria. Re, when delivered in RDLPMs as a dry powder inhaler, is a promising substitute for antibiotics in the treatment of <i>A. baumannii</i> pneumonia.	2023 Feb	Zicheng Yu, Tingting Wu, Xiaoyan Liu, Hongjun Chen, Chunxia Ren, Lifei Zhu	J Aerosol Med Pulm Drug Deliv
36626888	Identification of a novel LysR family transcriptional regulator controlling acquisition of sulfur sources in Acinetobacter baumannii.	L-cysteine biosynthesis from inorganic sulfur represents a major mechanism by which reduced sulfur is incorporated into organic compounds. Cysteine biosynthesis and regulation is well characterized in E. coli. However, the regulation of sulfur metabolism in Acinetobacter baumannii is only partly understood, with the LysR type regulator, GigC known to control some aspects of sulfur reduction. In this study, we have used transcriptomics and bioinformatic analyses to characterize a novel LysR-type transcriptional regulator encoded by ABUW_1016 (cbl), in a highly multidrug-resistant and virulent isolate of Acinetobacter baumannii. We have shown that Cbl is involved in controlling the expression of the genes required for uptake and reduction of various sulfur sources in A. baumannii. We have identified the global regulon of Cbl and proposed a model of cysteine biosynthesis and its regulation by Cbl and GigC in A. baumannii.	2023 Jan	Alaska Pokhrel, Hue Dinh, Liping Li, Karl A Hassan, Amy K Cain, Ian T Paulsen	Microb Physiol
37213517	Mobile genetic elements carrying aminoglycoside resistance genes in <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> isolates belonging to global clone 2.	Aminoglycosides are used to treat infections caused by carbapenem-resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> (CRAB) strains. However, resistance to aminoglycosides has increased remarkably in the last few years. Here, we aimed to determine the mobile genetic elements (MGEs) associated with resistance to aminoglycosides in the global clone 2 (GC2) <i>A. baumannii</i>. Among the 315 <i>A. baumannii</i> isolates, 97 isolates were identified as GC2, and 52 of GC2 isolates (53.6%) were resistant to all the aminoglycosides tested. The AbGRI3s carrying <i>armA</i> were detected in 88 GC2 isolates (90.7%), and of them, 17 isolates (19.3%) carried a new variant of AbGRI3 (AbGRI3<sub>ABI221</sub>). <i>aphA6</i> was located in Tn<i>aphA6</i> of 30 isolates out of 55 <i>aphA6</i>-harboring isolates, and 20 isolates were found to harbor Tn<i>aphA6</i> on a RepAci6 plasmid. Tn<i>6020</i> carrying <i>aphA1b</i> was detected in 51 isolates (52.5%), which was located within AbGRI2 resistance islands. The pRAY<sup>*</sup> carrying the <i>aadB</i> gene was detected in 43 isolates (44.3%), and no isolate was found to contain a class 1 integron harboring this gene. The GC2 <i>A. baumannii</i> isolates contained at least one MGE carrying the aminoglycoside resistance gene, located mostly either in the chromosome within AbGRIs or on the plasmids. Thus, it is likely that these MGEs play a role in the dissemination of aminoglycoside resistance genes in GC2 isolates from Iran.	2023	Ghazal Naderi, Malihe Talebi, Roghayeh Gheybizadeh, Arash Seifi, Sedigheh Ghourchian, Mohammad Rahbar, Alireza Abdollahi, Abdolhossein Naseri, Parisa Eslami, Masoumeh Douraghi	Front Microbiol
37185538	Evaluation of DNA Extraction Methods for Reliable Quantification of <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>, <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i>, and <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>.	Detection and quantification of DNA biomarkers relies heavily on the yield and quality of DNA obtained by extraction from different matrices. Although a large number of studies have compared the yields of different extraction methods, the repeatability and intermediate precision of these methods have been largely overlooked. In the present study, five extraction methods were evaluated, using digital PCR, to determine their efficiency in extracting DNA from three different Gram-negative bacteria in sputum samples. The performance of two automated methods (GXT NA and QuickPick genomic DNA extraction kit, using Arrow and KingFisher Duo automated systems, respectively), two manual kit-based methods (QIAamp DNA mini kit; DNeasy UltraClean microbial kit), and one manual non-kit method (CTAB), was assessed. While GXT NA extraction kit and the CTAB method have the highest DNA yield, they did not meet the strict criteria for repeatability, intermediate precision, and measurement uncertainty for all three studied bacteria. However, due to limited clinical samples, a compromise is necessary, and the GXT NA extraction kit was found to be the method of choice. The study also showed that dPCR allowed for accurate determination of extraction method repeatability, which can help standardize molecular diagnostic approaches. Additionally, the determination of absolute copy numbers facilitated the calculation of measurement uncertainty, which was found to be influenced by the DNA extraction method used.	2023 Apr	Alexandra Bogožalec Košir, Dane Lužnik, Viktorija Tomič, Mojca Milavec	Biosensors (Basel)

36845495	Removal of substrate inhibition of <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> xanthine oxidase by point mutation at Gln-201 enables efficient reduction of purine content in fish sauce.	Xanthine oxidase is an oxidase that has a molybdopterin structure with substrate inhibition. Here, we show that a single point mutation (Q201) in the <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> xanthine oxidase (AbXOD) obtained mutant Q201E (<i>k</i> <sub>cat</sub> =799.44 s<sup>-1</sup>, no inhibition) with high enzyme activity and decrease of substrate inhibition in 5 mmol/L high substrate model, and which cause two loops structure change at active center, characterized by complete loss of substrate inhibition without reduction of enzymatic activity. Molecular docking results showed that the change of flexible loop increased the affinity between substrate and enzyme, and the formation of a π-π bond and two hydrogen bonds made the substrate more stable in the active center. Ultimately, Q201E can still maintain better enzyme activity under high purine content (an approximately 7-fold improvement over the wild-type), indicating a broader application prospect in the manufacture of low-purine food.	2023 Mar	You Wen, Jiahui Xu, Donglei Pan, Chenghua Wang	Food Chem X
37171842	The evolutionary tale of eight novel plasmids in a colistin-resistant environmental <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> isolate.	<i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> is an important opportunistic pathogen known for its high levels of resistance to many antibiotics, particularly those considered last resorts such as colistin and carbapenems. Plasmids of this organism are increasingly associated with the spread of clinically important antibiotic resistance genes. Although <i>A. baumannii</i> is a ubiquitous organism, to date, most of the focus has been on studying strains recovered from clinical samples ignoring those isolated in the environment (soil, water, food, etc.). Here, we analysed the genetic structures of eight novel plasmids carried by an environmental colistin-resistant <i>A. baumannii</i> (strain E-072658) recovered in a recycled fibre pulp in a paper mill in Finland. It was shown that E-072658 carries a new variant of the <i>mcr-4</i> colistin resistance gene (<i>mcr-4.7</i>) in a novel Tn<i>3-</i>family transposon (called Tn<i>6926</i>) carried by a novel plasmid p8E072658. E-072658 is also resistant to sulphonamide compounds; consistent with this, the <i>sul2</i> sulphonamide resistance gene was found in a p<i>dif</i> module. E-072658 also carries six additional plasmids with no antibiotic resistance genes, but they contained several p<i>dif</i> modules shared with plasmids carried by clinical strains. Detailed analysis of the genetic structure of all eight plasmids carried by E-072658 showed a complex evolutionary history revealing genetic exchange events within the genus <i>Acinetobacter</i> beyond the clinical or environmental origin of the strains. This work provides evidence that environmental strains might act as a source for some of the clinically significant antibiotic resistance genes.	2023 May	Farzana T Prity, Liam A Tobin, Ram Maharajan, Ian T Paulsen, Amy K Cain, Mehrad Hamidian	Microb Genom
36711967	A novel strategy to characterize the pattern of β-lactam antibiotic-induced drug resistance in Acinetobacter baumannii.	Carbapenem-resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> (CRAb) is an urgent public health threat, according to the CDC. This pathogen has few treatment options and causes severe nosocomial infections with > 50% fatality rate. Although previous studies have examined the proteome of CRAb, there have been no focused analyses of dynamic changes to β-lactamase expression that may occur due to drug exposure. Here, we present our initial proteomic study of variation in β-lactamase expression that occurs in CRAb with different β-lactam antibiotics. Briefly, drug resistance to Ab (ATCC 19606) was induced by the administration of various classes of β-lactam antibiotics, and the cell-free supernatant was isolated, concentrated, separated by SDS-PAGE, digested with trypsin, and identified by label-free LC-MS-based quantitative proteomics. Peptides were identified and evaluated using a 1789 sequence database of Ab β-lactamases from UniProt. Importantly, we observed that different antibiotics, even those of the same class ( <i>e.g.</i> penicillin and amoxicillin), induce non-equivalent responses comprising various Class C and D serine-β-lactamases, resulting in unique resistomes.

37089710	Riparin-B as a Potential Inhibitor of AdeABC Efflux System from <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>.	<i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> is an important opportunistic pathogen that causes serious health-related infections, especially in intensive care units. The present study aimed to investigate the antimicrobial activity of Riparin-B (Rip-B) alone and in association with norfloxacin against multidrug-resistant clinical isolates of <i>A. baumannii</i>. For this, the minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined by the microdilution method. For the evaluation of resistance-modulating activity, MIC values for antibiotics were determined in the presence or absence of subinhibitory concentrations of Rip-B or chlorpromazine (CPZ). The AdeABC-AdeRS efflux system genes from these isolates were detected by PCR. Docking studies were also carried out to evaluate the interaction of Riparin-B and the AdeABC-AdeRS efflux system. The study was conducted from 2017 to 2019. The results showed that Rip-B showed weak intrinsic activity against the strains tested. On the other hand, Rip-B was able to modulate norfloxacin's response against <i>A. baumannii</i> strains that express efflux pump-mediated resistance. Docking studies provided projections of the interaction between Rip-B and EtBr with the AdeB protein, suggesting that Rip-B acts by competitive inhibition with the drug. Results found by in vitro and in silico assays suggest that Rip-B, in combination with norfloxacin, has the potential to treat infections caused by multidrug-resistant <i>A. baumanni</i> with efflux pump resistance.	2023	Patrícia Virna Sales Leão, Ana Laura da Silva Ferreira, Felipe Araújo de Alcântara Oliveira, Avilnete Belém de Souza Mesquita, José de Sousa Lima-Net, Stanley Juan Chavéz Gutierrez, Carlos Emídio Sampaio Nogueira, Natália Cruz-Martins, Daniel Dias Rufino Arcanjo, Humberto Medeiros Barreto, Josie Haydée Lima Ferreira	Evid Based Complement Alternat Med
36289054	Inhibitor Assessment against the LpxC Enzyme of Antibiotic-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii Using Virtual Screening, Dynamics Simulation, and in vitro Assays.	Bacterial resistance is currently a significant global public health problem. Acinetobacter baumannii has been ranked in the list of the World Health Organization as the most critical and priority pathogen for which new antibiotics are urgently needed. In this context, computational methods play a central role in the modern drug discovery process. The purpose of the current study was to identify new potential therapeutic molecules to neutralize MDR A. baumannii bacteria.	2023 Feb	Manel Zoghlami, Maroua Oueslati, Zarrin Basharat, Najla Sadfi-Zouaoui, Abdelmonaem Messaoudi	Mol Inform
36651782	Loss of a Branch Sugar in the Acinetobacter baumannii K3-Type Capsular Polysaccharide Due To Frameshifts in the <i>gtr6</i> Glycosyltransferase Gene Leads To Susceptibility To Phage APK37.1.	The type of capsular polysaccharide (CPS) on the cell surface of Acinetobacter baumannii can determine the specificity of lytic bacteriophage under consideration for therapeutic use. Here, we report the isolation of a phage on an extensively antibiotic resistant ST2 A. baumannii isolate AB5001 that carries the KL3 CPS biosynthesis gene cluster predicting a K3-type CPS. As the phage did not infect isolates carrying KL3 or KL22 and known to produce K3 CPS, the structure of the CPS isolated from A. baumannii AB5001 was determined. AB5001 produced a variant CPS form, K3-v1, that lacks the β-d-Glс<i>p</i>NAc side chain attached to the d-Gal<i>p</i> residue in the K3 structure. Inspection of the KL3 sequence in the genomes of AB5001 and other phage-susceptible isolates with a KL3 locus revealed single-base deletions in <i>gtr6</i>, causing loss of the Gtr6 glycosyltransferase that adds the missing d-Glс<i>p</i>NAc side chain to the K3 CPS. Hence, the presence of this sugar profoundly restricts the ability of the phage to digest the CPS. The 41-kb linear double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) phage genome was identical to the genome of a phage isolated on a K37-producing isolate and thus was named APK37.1. APK37.1 also infected isolates carrying KL116. Consistent with this, K3-v1 resembles the K37 and K116 structures. APK37.1 is a <i>Friunavirus</i> belonging to the <i>Autographiviridae</i> family. The phage-encoded tail spike depolymerase DpoAPK37.1 was not closely related to Dpo encoded by other sequenced <i>Friunaviruses</i>, including APK37 and APK116. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Lytic bacteriophage have potential for the treatment of otherwise untreatable extensively antibiotic-resistant bacteria. For Acinetobacter baumannii, most phage exhibit specificity for the type of capsular polysaccharide (CPS) produced on the cell surface. However, resistance can arise via mutations in CPS genes that abolish this phage receptor. Here, we show that single-base deletions in a CPS gene result in alteration of the final structure rather than deletion of the capsule layer and hence affect the ability of a newly reported podophage to infect strains producing the K3 CPS.	2023 Feb	Olga Y Timoshina, Anastasiya A Kasimova, Mikhail M Shneider, Nikolay P Arbatsky, Alexander S Shashkov, Andrey A Shelenkov, Yuliya V Mikhailova, Anastasiya V Popova, Ruth M Hall, Yuriy A Knirel, Johanna J Kenyon	Microbiol Spectr
36830214	Pulmonary Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Evaluation of Ampicillin/Sulbactam Regimens for Pneumonia Caused by Various Bacteria, including <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>.	This study aimed to assess the dosing regimens of ampicillin/sulbactam for pneumonia based on pulmonary pharmacokinetic (PK)/pharmacodynamic (PD) target attainment. Using the literature data, we developed pulmonary PK models and estimated the probabilities of attaining PK/PD targets in lung tissue. Against bacteria other than <i>A. baumannii</i> (the general treatment), the PK/PD target was set as both 50% time above the minimum inhibitory concentration (T > MIC) for ampicillin and 50% T > 0.5 MIC for sulbactam. For the <i>A. baumannii</i> treatment, the PK/PD target was set as 60% T > MIC for sulbactam. The pulmonary PK/PD breakpoint was defined as the highest minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) at which the target attainment probability in the lung tissue was ≥90%. The lung tissue/serum area under the drug concentration-time curve from 0 to 3 h (AUC<sub>0-3h</sub>) ratios for ampicillin and sulbactam were 0.881 and 0.368, respectively. The ampicillin/sulbactam AUC<sub>0-3h</sub> ratio in the lung tissue was 3.89. For the general treatment, the pulmonary PK/PD breakpoint for ampicillin/sulbactam at 3 g four times daily in typical patients with creatinine clearance (CL<sub>cr</sub>) of 60 mL/min was 2 μg/mL, which covered the MIC<sub>90s</sub> (the MICs that inhibited the growth of 90% of the strains) of most gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. For the <i>A. baumannii</i> treatment, the pulmonary PK/PD breakpoint for ampicillin/sulbactam at 9 g 4-h infusion three times daily (27 g/day) in patients with a CL<sub>cr</sub> of 60 mL/min was 4 μg/mL, which covered the MIC<sub>90</sub> of <i>A. baumannii</i>. A PK/PD evaluation for pneumonia should be performed in the lung tissue (the target site) rather than in the blood because sulbactam concentrations are lower in lung tissue. These findings should facilitate the selection of ampicillin/sulbactam regimens for pneumonia caused by various bacteria, including <i>A. baumannii</i>.	2023 Feb	Tetsushu Onita, Kazuro Ikawa, Noriyuki Ishihara, Hiroki Tamaki, Takahisa Yano, Kohji Naora, Norifumi Morikawa	Antibiotics (Basel)
37150474	Metaviromics analysis of marine biofilm reveals a glycoside hydrolase endolysin with high specificity towards Acinetobacter baumannii.	Multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria are a growing threat to the public health. Among them, the Gram-negative Acinetobacter baumannii is considered today as the most dangerous MDR pathogen. Phage-derived endolysins are peptidoglycan (PG) hydrolytic enzymes that can function as effective tools in the fight against MDR bacteria. In the present work, the viral diversity of a marine environmental sample (biofilm), formed near an industrial zone, was mined for the identification of a putative endolysin (AbLys2) that belongs to the glycoside hydrolase family 24 (GH24, EC 3.2.1.17). The coding sequence of AbLys2 was cloned and expressed in E. coli. The lytic activity and specificity of the recombinant enzyme were evaluated against suspensions of a range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative human pathogens using turbidity assays. AbLys2 displayed enhanced selectivity towards A. baumannii cells, compared to other bacteria. Kinetics analysis was carried out to characterize the dependence of its lytic activity on pH and showed that the enzyme exhibits its maximal activity at pH 5.5. Thermostability analysis showed that AbLys2 displays melting temperature T<sub>m</sub> 47.1 °C. Florescence microscopy and cell viability assays established that AbLys2 is active towards live cultures of A. baumannii cells with an inhibitory concentration IC<sub>50</sub> 3.41 ± 0.09 μM. Molecular modeling allowed the prediction of important amino acid residues involved in catalysis. The results of the present study suggest that AbLys2 provides efficient lytic and antimicrobial activity towards A. baumannii cells and therefore is a promising new antimicrobial against this pathogen.	2023 May	Georgios E Premetis, Nikolaos D Georgakis, Angeliki Stathi, Nikolaos E Labrou	Biochim Biophys Acta Proteins Proteom
36685419	Assessment of potassium ion channel during electric signalling in biofilm formation of <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> for finding antibiofilm molecule.	<i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> is an opportunistic ESKAPE pathogen which causes nosocomial infections and can produce biofilms that act as resistant determinants. The role of quorum sensing (chemical signaling) in biofilm establishment has already been studied extensively, but the existence of electrochemical signaling during biofilm formation by <i>A. baumannii</i> has not yet been investigated. The current study evaluated the presence of electrical signaling, types of ion channels involved, and their role in biofilm formation using spectroscopic and microbiological methods. The findings suggest that the potassium ion channel has a significant role in the electrical signaling during the biofilm formation by <i>A. baumannii</i>. Further, <i>in-silico</i> screening, molecular mechanics, and molecular dynamic simulation studies identify a potential lead, ZINC12496555(a specific inhibitor), which targets the potassium ion channel protein of <i>A. baumannii</i>. Mutational analysis of the interacting residues showed alterations in the unfolding rate of this protein after the selected mutation, which shows its role in the stability of this protein. It was also observed that identified lead has high antibiofilm activity, no human off-targets, and non-cytotoxicity to cell lines. Thus, identified lead against the potassium channel of <i>A baumannii</i> may be used as an effective therapeutic for the treatment of <i>A. baumannii</i> infections after further experimental validation.	2023 Jan	Monalisa Tiwari, Shruti Panwar, Vishvanath Tiwari	Heliyon

35794134	Overcoming addition of phosphoethanolamine to lipid A mediated colistin resistance in Acinetobacter baumannii clinical isolates with colistin-sulbactam combination therapy.	Overcoming colistin-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CoR-AB) has become a major concern due to the lack of effective antibiotics. This study aimed to explore the prevalence of CoR-AB clinical isolates in Thailand, their mechanisms of resistance, and test the efficacy of colistin plus sulbactam against CoR-AB isolates. The colistin resistance rate among carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii was 15.14%. The mcr gene or its variants were not detected in CoR-AB isolates by PCR screening. The lipid A mass spectra of CoR-AB isolates showed the additional [M-H]<sup>-</sup> ion peak at m/z = 2034 that correlated to the phosphoethanolamine (pEtN) addition to lipid A (N = 27/30). The important amino acid substitutions were found at position S14P, A138T, A227V in PmrB that are associated with overexpression of the pEtN transferase (PmrC) and contributed the pEtN addition. The lipopolysacccharide production genes (lpxACD) were not related to lipid A mass spectra. A colistin plus sulbactam combination exhibited the synergy rate at 86.7% against CoR-AB isolates compare to sulbactam (85.89% resistance) or colistin (15.14% resistance) alone. The excellent synergistic activity of colistin plus sulbactam combination has the potential for the treatment of CoR-AB infections.	2022 Jul	Sukrit Srisakul, Dhammika Leshan Wannigama, Paul G Higgins, Cameron Hurst, Shuichi Abe, Parichart Hongsing, Thammakorn Saethang, Sirirat Luk-In, Tingting Liao, Naris Kueakulpattana, Aye Mya Sithu Shein, Lin Gan, Rosalyn Kupwiwat, Chanikan Tanasatitchai, Pattama Wapeesittipan, Phatthranit Phattharapornjaroen, Vishnu Nayak Badavath, Asada Leelahavanichkul, Tanittha Chatsuwan	Sci Rep

36905104	Evaluation of combination therapies with colistin in an experimental mouse pneumonia model induced by carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii strain.	The treatment options are limited in Acinetobacter baumannii infections. In this study, the effectiveness of colistin monotherapy and combinations of colistin with different antibiotics were investigated in an experimental pneumonia model induced by carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii strain. Mice in the study were divided into five groups as control (no treatment), colistin monotherapy, colistin + sulbactam, colistin + imipenem, and colistin + tigecycline combinations. The modified experimental surgical pneumonia model of Esposito and Pennington was applied to all groups. The presence of bacteria in blood and lung samples was investigated. Results were compared. In blood cultures, while there was no difference between the control and colistin groups, there was a statistical difference between the control and the combination groups (P = 0.029). When the groups were compared in terms of lung tissue culture positivity, there was a statistical difference between the control group and all treatment groups (colistin, colistin + sulbactam, colistin + imipenem, and colistin + tigecycline) (P = 0.026, P < 0.001, P < 0.001, and P = 0.002, respectively). The number of microorganisms that grew in the lung tissue was found to be statistically significantly lower in all treatment groups in comparison with the control group (P = 0.001). Both monotherapy and combination therapies of colistin were found to be effective in the treatment of carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii pneumonia, but the superiority of combination therapies over colistin monotherapy has not been demonstrated.	2023 Mar	Onur Unal, Onur Kaya, Tuba Ozturk, Emel Sesli Cetin, Ibak Gonen, Esra Nurlu Temel, Fusun Zeynep Akcam	Fundam Clin Pharmacol

36446189	Complete chemical structure of the K135 capsular polysaccharide produced by Acinetobacter baumannii RES-546 that contains 5,7-di-N-acetyl-8-epipseudaminic acid.	A structurally diverse capsular polysaccharide (CPS) in the outer cell envelope plays an important role in the virulence of the important bacterial pathogen, Acinetobacter baumannii. More than 75 different CPS structures have been determined for the species to date, and many CPSs include isomers of a higher sugar, namely 5,7-diamino-3,5,7,9-tetradeoxynon-2-ulosonic acid. Recently, a novel isomer having the d-glycero-l-manno configuration (5,7-di-N-acetyl-8-epipseudaminic acid; 8ePse5Ac7Ac) has been identified in the CPS from A. baumannii clinical isolate RES-546 [Carbohydr. Res. 513 (2022) 108,531]. Here, the complete chemical structure of this CPS, designated K135, was elucidated. The CPS was found to have a branched tetrasaccharide K unit and to include the higher sugar as part of a 8ePse5Ac7Ac-(2 → 6)-α-Gal disaccharide branching from a →3)-α-D-GlcpNAc-(1 → 3)-β-D-GlcpNAc-(1→ main chain. Assignment of glycosyltransferases encoded by the CPS biosynthesis gene cluster in the RES-546 genome enabled the first sugar of the K unit, and hence the topology of the K135 CPS, to be determined.	2023 Jan	Alexander S Shashkov, Anastasiya A Kasimova, Nikolay P Arbatsky, Sof'ya N Senchenkova, Andrei V Perepelov, Andrei S Dmitrenok, Alexander O Chizhov, Yuriy A Knirel, Mikhail M Shneider, Anastasia V Popova, Johanna J Kenyon	Carbohydr Res
35663863	Identification of Promoter Region Markers Associated With Altered Expression of Resistance-Nodulation-Division Antibiotic Efflux Pumps in <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>.	Genetic alterations leading to the constitutive upregulation of specific efflux pumps contribute to antibacterial resistance in multidrug resistant bacteria. The identification of such resistance markers remains one of the most challenging tasks of genome-level resistance predictors. In this study, 487 non-redundant genetic events were identified in upstream zones of three operons coding for resistance-nodulation-division (RND) efflux pumps of 4,130 <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> isolates. These events included insertion sequences, small indels, and single nucleotide polymorphisms. In some cases, alterations explicitly modified the expression motifs described for these operons, such as the promoter boxes, operators, and Shine-Dalgarno sequences. In addition, changes in DNA curvature and mRNA secondary structures, which are structural elements that regulate expression, were also calculated. According to their influence on RND upregulation, the catalog of upstream modifications were associated with "experimentally verified," "presumed," and "probably irrelevant" degrees of certainty. For experimental verification, DNA of upstream sequences independently carrying selected markers, three for each RND operon, were fused to a luciferase reporter plasmid system. Five out of the nine selected markers tested showed significant increases in expression with respect to the wild-type sequence control. In particular, a 25-fold expression increase was observed with the IS<i>Aba</i>1 insertion sequence upstream the <i>adeABC</i> pump. Next, overexpression of each of the three multi-specific RND pumps was linked to their respective antibacterial substrates by a deep <i>A. baumannii</i> literature screen. Consequently, a data flow framework was then developed to link genomic upregulatory RND determinants to potential antibiotic resistance. Assignment of potential increases in minimal inhibitory concentrations at the "experimentally verified" level was permitted for 42 isolates to 7-8 unrelated antibacterial agents including tigecycline, which is overlooked by conventional resistome predictors. Thus, our protocol may represent a time-saving filter step prior to laborious confirmation experiments for efflux-driven resistance. Altogether, a computational-experimental pipeline containing all components required for identifying the upstream regulatory resistome is proposed. This schema may provide the foundational stone for the elaboration of tools approaching antibiotic efflux that complement routine resistome predictors for preventing antimicrobial therapy failure against difficult-to-threat bacteria.	2022	Mireia López-Siles, Michael J McConnell, Antonio J Martín-Galiano	Front Microbiol
36630484	Catheterization of mice triggers resurgent urinary tract infection seeded by a bladder reservoir of <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>.	The antibiotic-resistant bacterium <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> is a leading cause of hospital-associated infections. Despite surveillance and infection control efforts, new <i>A. baumannii</i> strains are regularly isolated from health care facilities worldwide. In a mouse model of urinary tract infection, we found that mice infected with <i>A. baumannii</i> displayed high bacterial burdens in urine for several weeks. Two months after the resolution of <i>A. baumannii</i> infection, inserting a catheter into the bladder of mice with resolved infection led to the resurgence of a same-strain urinary tract infection in ~53% of the mice within 24 hours. We identified intracellular <i>A. baumannii</i> bacteria in the bladder epithelial cells of mice with resolved infection, which we propose could act as a host reservoir that was activated upon insertion of a catheter, leading to a resurgent secondary infection.	2023 Jan	Jennie E Hazen, Gisela Di Venanzio, Scott J Hultgren, Mario F Feldman	Sci Transl Med
37018343	Use of the waxworm Galleria mellonella larvae as an infection model to study Acinetobacter baumannii.	Galleria mellonella larvae have been increasingly used in research, including microbial infection studies. They act as suitable preliminary infection models to study host-pathogen interactions due to their advantages, such as the ability to survive at 37°C mimicking human body temperature, their immune system shares similarities with mammalian immune systems, and their short life cycle allowing large-scale studies. Here, we present a protocol for simple rearing and maintenance of G. mellonella without requiring special instruments and specialized training. This allows the continuous supply of healthy G. mellonella for research purposes. Besides, this protocol also provides detailed procedures on the (i) G. mellonella infection assays (killing assay and bacterial burden assay) for virulence studies and (ii) bacterial cell harvesting from infected larvae and RNA extraction for bacterial gene expression studies during infection. Our protocol could not only be used in the studies of A. baumannii virulence but can also be modified according to different bacterial strains.	2023	Kah Ern Ten, Nazmul Hasan Muzahid, Sadequr Rahman, Hock Siew Tan	PLoS One
35060164	Intraventricular colistin sulphate as a last resort therapy in a patient with multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii induced post-neurosurgical ventriculitis.	Limited therapeutic options exist for multidrug-resistant/extensively drug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (MDR/XDR-Ab) meningitis/ventriculitis. A combination of intravenous and intraventricular (IVT)/intrathecal (IT) polymyxins achieves good therapeutic outcomes for cases of healthcare-associated MDR/XDR-Ab meningitis/ventriculitis. Colistin is commercially available as colistin sulphate and its sulphomethylated derivative. However, the effect and safety of colistin sulphate in the treatment of MDR/XDR-Ab meningitis/ventriculitis has not been reported. We report on a 66-year-old male patient who developed post-neurosurgical ventriculitis caused by MDR-Ab. IVT concomitant intravenous colistin sulphate was used as a last-resort antimicrobial therapy, the patient's ventriculitis was dramatically improved, and the concentrations of CSF colistin were higher than the MIC breakpoint throughout the treatment. Meanwhile, no nephrotoxicity or neurotoxicity was observed during the treatment.	2022 Jul	Xu-Ben Yu, Yue-Yue Huang, Xiao-Shan Zhang, Yu-Zhen Wang, Da-Wei Shi, Chun-Hong Zhang, Jie Chen, Xiao-Rong Wang, Guan-Yang Lin	Br J Clin Pharmacol
37156803	Antibacterial activity of vB_AbaM_PhT2 phage hydrophobic amino acid fusion endolysin, combined with colistin against Acinetobacter baumannii.	Phage lytic enzymes are promising antimicrobial agents. In this study, an endolysin derived from vB_AbaM_PhT2 (vPhT2), was identified. This endolysin represented the conserved lysozyme domain. Recombinant endolysin (lysAB- vT2) and hydrophobic fusion endolysin (lysAB-vT2-fusion) were expressed and purified. Both endolysins showed lytic activity against bacterial crude cell wall of Gram-negative bacteria. The MIC of lysAB-vT2-fusion was 2 mg/ml corresponding to 100 µM, while the MIC of lysAB-vT2 was more than 10 mg/ml (400 µM). Combination of lysAB-vT2-fusion with colistin, polymyxin B or copper was synergistic against A. baumannii (FICI value as 0.25). Antibacterial activity of lysAB-vT2-fusion plus colistin at the fractional inhibitory concentrations (FICs) revealed that it can inhibit Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and various strains of extremely drug-resistant A. baumannii (XDRAB) and phage resistant A. baumannii. The lysAB- vT2-fusion still retained its antibacterial activity after incubating the enzyme at 4, 20, 40 and 60 °C for 30 min. The lysAB-vT2-fusion could inhibit the mature biofilm, and incubation of lysAB-vT2-fusion with T24 human cells infected with A. baumannii led to a partial reduction of LDH release from T24 cells. In summary, our study highlights the antimicrobial ability of engineered lysAB-vT2-fusion endolysin, which can be applied for the control of A. baumannii infection.	2023 May	Sutthirat Sitthisak, Suphattra Manrueang, Supat Khongfak, Udomluk Leungtongkam, Rapee Thummeepak, Aunchalee Thanwisai, Nathan Burton, Gurneet K Dhanoa, Panagiotis Tsapras, Antonia P Sagona	Sci Rep
37140387	Identification of an Outbreak Cluster of Extensively Antibiotic-Resistant GC1 Acinetobacter baumannii Isolates in U.S. Military Treatment Facilities.	An outbreak involving an extensively antibiotic-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii strain in three military treatment facilities was identified. Fifty-nine isolates recovered from 30 patients over a 4-year period were found among a large collection of isolates using core genome multilocus sequence typing (MLST). They differed by only 0 to 18 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and carried the same resistance determinants except that the <i>aphA6</i> gene was missing in 25 isolates. They represent a novel sublineage of GC1 lineage 1 that likely originated in Afghanistan. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> A. baumannii is recognized as one of the most important nosocomial pathogens, and carbapenem-resistant strains pose a particularly difficult treatment challenge. Outbreaks linked to this pathogen are reported worldwide, particularly during periods of societal upheaval, such as natural disasters and conflicts. Understanding how this organism enters and establishes itself within the hospital environment is key to interrupting transmission, but few genomic studies have examined these transmissions over a prolonged period. Though historical, this report provides an in-depth analysis of nosocomial transmission of this organism across continents and within and between different hospitals.	2023 May	Ting L Luo, Christopher J Harmer, Francois Lebreton, Jason Stam, Jason W Bennett, Ruth M Hall, Patrick T Mc Gann	Microbiol Spectr

36420820	Clearing an ESKAPE Pathogen in a Model Organism; A Polypyridyl Ruthenium(II) Complex Theranostic that Treats a Resistant Acinetobacter baumannii Infection in Galleria mellonella.	In previous studies we have described the therapeutic action of luminescent dinuclear ruthenium(II) complexes based on the tetrapyridylphenazine, tpphz, bridging ligand on pathogenic strains of Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis. Herein, the antimicrobial activity of the complex against pernicious Gram-negative ESKAPE pathogenic strains of Acinetobacter baumannii (AB12, AB16, AB184 and AB210) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA2017, PA_ 007_ IMP and PA_ 004_ CRCN) are reported. Estimated minimum inhibitory concentrations and minimum bactericidal concentrations for the complexes revealed the complex shows potent activity against all A. baumannii strains, in both glucose defined minimal media and standard nutrient rich Mueller-Hinton-II. Although the activity was lower in P. aureginosa, a moderately high potency was observed and retained in carbapenem-resistant strains. Optical microscopy showed that the compound is rapidly internalized by A. baumannii. As previous reports had revealed the complex exhibited no toxicity in Galleria Mellonella up to concentrations of 80 mg/kg, the ability to clear pathogenic infection within this model was explored. The pathogenic concentrations to the larvae for each bacterium were determined to be≥10<sup>5</sup> for AB184 and≥10<sup>3</sup> CFU/mL for PA2017. It was found a single dose of the compound totally cleared a pathogenic A. baumannii infection from all treated G. mellonella within 96 h. Uniquely, in these conditions thanks to the imaging properties of the complex the clearance of the bacteria within the hemolymph of G. mellonella could be directly visualized through both optical and transmission electron microscopy.	2023 Feb	Kirsty Smitten, Hannah M Southam, Simon Fairbanks, Arthur Graf, Adrien Chauvet, Jim A Thomas	Chemistry
35603837	Genomic surveillance uncovers ongoing transmission of carbapenem-resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> (CRAB) and identifies actionable routes of transmissions in an endemic setting.	In our center, previous infection prevention and control (IPC) resources were concentrated on multidrug-resistant organisms other than CRAB because the rate of CRAB was stable with no evidence of outbreaks. Triggered by an increase in the baseline rate of CRAB isolated in clinical cultures, we investigated horizontal transmission of CRAB to guide targeted IPC actions.	2023 Mar	Sean Wei Xiang Ong, Pooja Rao, Wei Xin Khong, Victor Yi Fa Ong, Prakki Sai Rama Sridatta, Natascha May Thevasagayam, Benjamin Choon Heng Ho, Brenda Sze Peng Ang, Partha Pratim De, Oon Tek Ng, Kalisvar Marimuthu	Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol
36831178	The Iron Content of Human Serum Albumin Modulates the Susceptibility of <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> to Cefiderocol.	The mortality rates of patients infected with <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> who were treated with cefiderocol (CFDC) were not as favorable as those receiving the best available treatment for pulmonary and bloodstream infections. Previous studies showed that the presence of human serum albumin (HSA) or HSA-containing fluids, such as human serum (HS) or human pleural fluid (HPF), in the growth medium is correlated with a decrease in the expression of genes associated with high-affinity siderophore-mediated iron uptake systems. These observations may explain the complexities of the observed clinical performance of CFDC in pulmonary and bloodstream infections, because ferric siderophore transporters enhance the penetration of CFDC into the bacterial cell. The removal of HSA from HS or HPF resulted in a reduction in the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of CFDC. Concomitant with these results, an enhancement in the expression of TonB-dependent transporters known to play a crucial role in transporting iron was observed. In addition to inducing modifications in iron-uptake gene expression, the removal of HSA also decreased the expression of β-lactamases genes. Taken together, these observations suggest that environmental HSA has a role in the expression levels of select <i>A. baumannii</i> genes. Furthermore, the removal of iron from HSA had the same effect as the removal of HSA upon the expression of genes associated with iron uptake systems, also suggesting that at least one of the mechanisms by which HSA regulates the expression of certain genes is through acting as an iron source.	2023 Feb	Jenny Escalante, Brent Nishimura, Marisel R Tuttobene, Tomás Subils, Vyanka Mezcord, Luis A Actis, Marcelo E Tolmasky, Robert A Bonomo, María Soledad Ramirez	Biomedicines

36971982	Novel Antimicrobial Peptide SAAP Mutant as a Better Adjuvant to Sulbactam-Based Treatments Against Clinical Strains of XDR Acinetobacter baumannii.	The production of extended spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs) in extensively drug-resistant (XDR) strains of Acinetobacter baumannii has created havoc amongst clinicians making the treatment procedure challenging. Carbapenem-resistant strains have displayed total ineffectiveness towards newer combinations of β-lactam-β-lactamase inhibitors (βL-βLI) in tertiary healthcare settings. Therefore, the present study was aimed to design potential β-lactamase antimicrobial peptide (AMP) inhibitors against ESBLs produced by the strains. We have constructed an AMP mutant library with higher antimicrobial efficacy (range: ~ 15 to 27%) than their parent peptides. The mutants were thoroughly screened based on different physicochemical and immunogenic properties revealing three peptides, namely SAAP-148, HFIAP-1, myticalin-C6 and their mutants with safe pharmacokinetics profile. Molecular docking highlighted SAAP-148_M15 displaying maximum inhibitory potential with lowest binding energies against NDM1 (- 1148.7 kcal/mol), followed by OXA23 (- 1032.5 kcal/mol) and OXA58 (- 925.3 kcal/mol). The intermolecular interaction profiles displayed SAAP-148_M15 exhibiting hydrogen bonds and van der Waals hydrophobic interactions with the crucial residues of metallo β-lactamase [IPR001279] and penicillin-binding transpeptidase [IPR001460] domains. Coarse-grained clustering and molecular dynamics simulations (MDS) further validated the stable backbone profile and minimal residue-level fluctuations of the protein-peptide complex that were maintained throughout the simulation timeframe. The present study hypothesised that the combination of sulbactam (βL) with SAAP-148_M15 (βLI) holds immense potential in inhibiting the ESBLs alongside restoration of sulbactam activity. The current in silico findings upon further experimental validations can pave path towards designing of successful therapeutic strategy against XDR strains of A. baumannii.	2023 Mar	Aniket Naha, Sudha Ramaiah	Probiotics Antimicrob Proteins
33593839	Targeting Superoxide dismutase confers enhanced Reactive Oxygen Species mediated eradication of Polymyxin B induced <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> persisters.	Bacterial persisters represent non-inheritable drug tolerant population that are linked to recalcitrance of infections in healthcare settings. The rise of antibiotic resistance and depletion of new antibiotics in drug discovery pipeline has made the task of persister eradication more daunting. In the present study, we report that treatment of <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> with the last resort antibiotic polymyxin B displays continuous variation in tolerance among different clinical isolates. Mechanistically, Polymyxin B persisters exhibit disruption of proton motive force led delocalisation of cell division protein to attain a growth arrested phenotype. Tolerance studies on mutant strains revealed that superoxide dismutase (<i>sodB</i>) activity is a major contributor in tolerance of <i>A. baumannii</i> to polymyxin B. Using a dual fluorescence based persister detection system, screening of various antibiotics was performed to eradicate polymyxin B induced persisters of <i>A. baumannii</i> Rifampicin exhibited eradication of polymyxin B tolerant population by log reduction of 6 in magnitude against different clinical isolates of <i>A. baumannii</i> We establish that enhanced generation of ROS by rifampicin leads to clearance of these polymyxin B persisters. It was further demonstrated, as a proof of concept, that rifampicin potentiates the killing of polymyxin B persisters in murine wound infection model. We found that the effects were linked to significant down regulation of <i>sodB</i> by rifampicin, which contributes to higher generation of ROS in polymyxin B tolerant cells. In view of these results, we propose that the combination of polymyxin B and rifampicin is an effective antipersister strategy in clearing polymyxin B induced <i>A. baumannii</i> persisters.	2023 May	Vineet Dubey, Rinki Gupta, Ranjana Pathania	Antimicrob Agents Chemother

35483311	The role of quorum sensing, biofilm formation, and iron acquisition as key virulence mechanisms in Acinetobacter baumannii and the corresponding anti-virulence strategies.	Acinetobacter baumannii is a nosocomial pathogen responsible for several serious infections, including pneumonia, sepsis, and meningitis. The propensity of this bacterium to rapidly acquire antibiotic resistance leads to the emergence and spread of multidrug-resistant A. baumannii strains. As a result, antibiotics are becoming less effective in treating infections caused by this pathogen. In recent years, increasing efforts have focused on developing therapeutic compounds that could reduce the ability of A. baumannii to establish infection by inhibiting the virulence factors and pathogenesis of this pathogen without interfering with the bacterial viability. These alternative therapeutic options may impose milder selective pressure, reducing the likelihood of anti-virulence resistance development. To develop novel anti-virulence therapies, an in-depth understanding of the bacterial virulence mechanisms is crucial to identifying potential drug targets. This review summarises the latest discoveries about the virulence of A. baumannii, focusing on quorum sensing, biofilm formation, and iron acquisition, along with the corresponding anti-virulence strategies. This article also elaborates on the practical challenges involved in developing anti-virulence drugs. Therapeutic agents that target bacterial virulence factors may play a crucial role in controlling infection in the human host. Combining anti-virulence agents with existing antibiotics could enhance the therapeutic potential of these antibiotics against A. baumannii. Although anti-virulence therapy has been envisioned as an attractive alternative to overcome antimicrobial resistance, additional research on the possibility of developing resistance against anti-virulence drugs is encouraged to evaluate the sustainability of these strategies. Moreover, future studies on the efficacy of anti-virulence therapy against a diverse panel of clinical isolates and in polymicrobial A. baumannii infections are required to provide more valuable information about its clinical application.	2022 Jul	Soffi Kei Kei Law, Hock Siew Tan	Microbiol Res

37184409	Identification of a Specific Biomarker of Acinetobacter baumannii Global Clone 1 by Machine Learning and PCR Related to Metabolic Fitness of ESKAPE Pathogens.	Since the emergence of high-risk clones worldwide, constant investigations have been undertaken to comprehend the molecular basis that led to their prevalent dissemination in nosocomial settings over time. So far, the complex and multifactorial genetic traits of this type of epidemic clones have allowed only the identification of biomarkers with low specificity. A machine learning algorithm was able to recognize unequivocally a biomarker for early and accurate detection of Acinetobacter baumannii global clone 1 (GC1), one of the most disseminated high-risk clones. A support vector machine model identified the U1 sequence with a length of 367 nucleotides that matched a fragment of the <i>moaCB</i> gene, which encodes the molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis C and B proteins. U1 differentiates specifically between A. baumannii GC1 and non-GC1 strains, becoming a suitable biomarker capable of being translated into clinical settings as a molecular typing method for early diagnosis based on PCR as shown here. Since the metabolic pathways of Mo enzymes have been recognized as putative therapeutic targets for ESKAPE (Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter species) pathogens, our findings highlight that machine learning can also be useful in knowledge gaps of high-risk clones and provides noteworthy support to the literature to identify relevant nosocomial biomarkers for other multidrug-resistant high-risk clones. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> A. baumannii GC1 is an important high-risk clone that rapidly develops extreme drug resistance in the nosocomial niche. Furthermore, several strains have been identified worldwide in environmental samples, exacerbating the risk of human interactions. Early diagnosis is mandatory to limit its dissemination and to outline appropriate antibiotic stewardship schedules. A region with a length of 367 bp (U1) within the <i>moaCB</i> gene that is not subjected to lateral genetic transfer or to antibiotic pressures was successfully found by a support vector machine model that predicts A. baumannii GC1 strains. At the same time, research on the group of Mo enzymes proposed this metabolic pathway related to the superbug's metabolism as a potential future drug target site for ESKAPE pathogens due to its central role in bacterial fitness during infection. These findings confirm that machine learning used for the identification of biomarkers of high-risk lineages can also serve to identify putative novel therapeutic target sites.	2023 May	Verónica Elizabeth Álvarez, María Paula Quiroga, Daniela Centrón	mSystems
37110495	Molecular Epidemiological Investigation and Management of Outbreak Caused by Carbapenem-Resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> in a Neonatal Intensive Care Unit.	The present study describes an epidemiological investigation into a carbapenem-resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> (CRAB) outbreak, which had occurred in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), and the subsequent strengthening of infection control interventions. Upon the onset of the outbreak, existing infection control interventions were reviewed, and a set of containment measures were instituted. All CRAB isolates were characterized in terms of antimicrobial susceptibility testing and their genetic relatedness. The investigation process identified gaps within the NICU's existing infection control measures, which had likely resulted in the outbreak. CRAB was isolated from nine preterm infants: five colonized and four infected. All five colonized patients were discharged well. However, three out of four of the infected infants died. Outbreak investigation and genomic subtyping of environmental swabs revealed that mini syringe drivers shared between patients and a sink in the milk preparation room had served as CRAB reservoirs with possible transmission via the hands of healthcare workers. Implementation of immediate actions such as reinforcement of hand hygiene practices, intensified environmental cleaning, geographical cohorting, reviewing of milk handling practices and sink management protocol had resulted in no further CRAB isolation. The CRAB outbreak in the NICU underlines the importance of consistent compliance with infection-control interventions. Integration of epidemiological and microbiological data, together with comprehensive preventive measures, successfully brought the outbreak to a halt.	2023 Apr	Jia Jie Woon, Azanna Ahmad Kamar, Cindy Shuan Ju Teh, Nuryana Idris, Rosliza Zhazali, Suzana Saaibon, Harvinderjit Kaur Basauhra Singh, Jasreena Kaur Gill Charanjeet Singh, Adeeba Kamarulzaman, Sasheela Ponnampalavanar	Microorganisms
36735546	Protein Therapeutic Target Candidates Against <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>, a Pathogen of Concern to Planetary Health: A Network-Based Integrative Omics Drug Discovery Approach.	<i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>, an opportunistic gram-negative pathogen responsible for several nosocomial infections, has developed resistance to various antibiotics. Proteins involved in the two-component system (TCS), virulence, and antibiotic resistance (AR), help this pathogen in regulating antibiotic susceptibility and virulence mechanisms. The present study reports a network-based integrative omics approach to drug discovery to identify key regulatory proteins as therapeutic candidates against <i>A. baumannii</i>. We collected data on the TCS, virulence, and AR proteins from various databases (P2CS, VFDB, ARDB, and PAIDB), which were subjected to network, host-pathogen, and gene expression data analysis. Network analysis identified 43 hubs, and 10 proteins were found to be interacting with human proteins associated with vital pathways. Of the 53 (43 + 10) pathogen proteins, 46 had no orthologs in the human host. Twelve proteins, namely, RpfC, Wzc, OmpR, EnvZ, BfmS, PilG, histidine kinase, ABC 3 transport family protein, outer membrane porin OprD family, CsuD, Pgm, and LpxA, were differentially expressed in the resistant strain. We propose these proteins as key regulators that warrant evaluation as therapeutic target candidates in the future. Furthermore, structure prediction of ABC 3 transport family protein was performed as a case study. The findings from this study are poised to facilitate and inform drug discovery and development against <i>A. baumannii.</i>	2023 Feb	Aishwarya Swain, Archana Pan	OMICS
36483204	The combination effect of meropenem/sulbactam/polymyxin-B on the pharmacodynamic parameters for mutant selection windows against carbapenem-resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>.	The objective of this study was to evaluate whether combinations of sulbactam, meropenem, and polymyxin-B could reduce or close the gap of mutant selection window (MSW) of individual antibiotics against <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> harboring OXA-23. MICs of three antimicrobials used alone and in combination (meropenem/polymyxin-B or meropenem/polymyxin-B/sulbactam) were obtained in 11 clinical isolates and mutant prevention concentrations were determined in 4 of the 11 isolates. All isolates were resistant to meropenem or polymyxin-B. Combining meropenem and polymyxin-B with or without sulbactam resulted in synergistic bactericidal activities. Pharmacokinetic (PK) simulations of drug concentrations in the blood and epithelial lining fluid coupled with pharmacodynamic (PD) evaluations revealed that the fractions of time over the 24-h in terms of free drug concentration within the MSW (<i>f</i>T<sub>MSW</sub>) and above the MPC (<i>f</i>T<sub>>MPC</sub>) were optimized by combination therapy. The resultant clinical regimens of meropenem, polymyxin-B, and sulbactam evaluated in the PK-PD analysis were 2 g q8h, 2.5 mg/kg loading dose followed by 1.5 mg/kg q12h, and 3 g q8h, respectively, in patients with normal renal function. Subsequent corresponding equivalent exposure regimens would depend on the extent of renal failure. The overall results indicate that combination antibiotics consisting of sulbactam/meropenem/polymyxin-B can confer potential efficacy against <i>A. baumannii</i> harboring OXA-23, and reduce the opportunity for bacteria to develop further resistance. This study provides a framework for pharmacodynamic evaluation of drug-resistant mutant suppression in an antimicrobial co-administration setting. The results thereby lay the groundwork for additional studies and future clinical confirmation is warranted.	2022	Jiayuan Zhang, Shuo Diao, Yanfei Liu, Hongxiang Wang, Yuwei Liu, Shixing Zhu, Kun Feng, Xiaoqian Tang, Charles Oo, Peijuan Zhu, Zhihua Lv, Mingming Yu, Sherwin K B Sy, Yuanqi Zhu	Front Microbiol
36121221	Assessing the Role of Cold-Shock Protein C: a Novel Regulator of Acinetobacter baumannii Biofilm Formation and Virulence.	Acinetobacter baumannii is a formidable opportunistic pathogen that is notoriously difficult to eradicate from hospital settings. This resilience is often attributed to a proclivity for biofilm formation, which facilitates a higher tolerance toward external stress, desiccation, and antimicrobials. Despite this, little is known regarding the mechanisms orchestrating A. baumannii biofilm formation. Here, we performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) on biofilm and planktonic populations for the multidrug-resistant isolate AB5075 and identified 438 genes with altered expression. To assess the potential role of genes upregulated within biofilms, we tested the biofilm-forming capacity of their respective mutants from an A. baumannii transposon library. In so doing, we uncovered 24 genes whose disruption led to reduced biofilm formation. One such element, cold shock protein C (<i>cspC</i>), had a highly mucoid colony phenotype, enhanced tolerance to polysaccharide degradation, altered antibiotic tolerance, and diminished adherence to abiotic surfaces. RNA-seq of the <i>cspC</i> mutant revealed 201 genes with altered expression, including the downregulation of pili and fimbria genes and the upregulation of multidrug efflux pumps. Using transcriptional arrest assays, it appears that CspC mediates its effects, at least in part, through RNA chaperone activity, influencing the half-life of several important transcripts. Finally, we show that CspC is required for survival during challenge by the human immune system and is key for A. baumannii dissemination and/or colonization during systemic infection. Collectively, our work identifies a cadre of new biofilm-associated genes within A. baumannii and provides unique insight into the global regulatory network of this emerging human pathogen.	2022 Oct	Brooke R Tomlinson, Grant A Denham, Nathanial J Torres, Robert S Brzozowski, Jessie L Allen, Jessica K Jackson, Prahathees J Eswara, Lindsey N Shaw	Infect Immun
35831359	Genomic analysis uncovers laccase-coding genes and biosynthetic gene clusters encoding antimicrobial compounds in laccase-producing Acinetobacter baumannii.	Laccases are multicopper oxidase family enzymes that can oxidize various substrates. In this study, we isolated laccase-producing Acinetobacter spp. from the environment, and one isolate of laccase-producing Acinetobacter baumannii, designated NI-65, was identified. The NI-65 strain exhibited constitutive production of extracellular laccase in a crude extract using 2,6-dimethoxyphenol as a substrate when supplemented with 2 mM CuSO<sub>4</sub>. Whole-genome sequencing of the NI-65 strain revealed a genome size of 3.6 Mb with 3,471 protein-coding sequences. The phylogenetic analysis showed high similarity to the genome of A. baumannii NCIMB8209. Three laccase proteins, PcoA and CopA, that belong to bacterial CopA superfamilies, and LAC-AB, that belongs to the I-bacterial bilirubin oxidase superfamily, were identified. These proteins were encoded by three laccase-coding genes (pcoA, copA, and lac-AB). The lac-AB gene showed a sequence similar to that of polyphenol oxidase (PPO). Gene clusters encoding the catabolized compounds involved in the utilization of plant substances and secondary metabolite biosynthesis gene clusters encoding antimicrobial compounds were identified. This is the first report of whole-genome sequencing of laccase-producing A. baumannii, and the data from this study help to elucidate the genome of A. baumannii to facilitate its application in synthetic biology for enzyme production.	2022 Jul	Renuka Pooalai, Supat Khongfak, Udomluk Leungtongkam, Rapee Thummeepak, Duangkamol Kunthalert, Sutthirat Sitthisak	Sci Rep

36604484	BfmRS encodes a regulatory system involved in light signal transduction modulating motility and desiccation tolerance in the human pathogen Acinetobacter baumannii.	We have previously shown that Acinetobacter baumannii as well as other relevant clinical bacterial pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, perceive and respond to light at 37 °C, the normal temperature in mammal hosts. In this work, we present evidence indicating that the two-component system BfmRS transduces a light signal in A. baumannii at this temperature, showing selective involvement of the BfmR and BfmS components depending on the specific cellular process. In fact, both BfmR and BfmS participate in modulation of motility by light, while only BfmR is involved in light regulation of desiccation tolerance in this microorganism. Neither BfmR nor BfmS contain a photoreceptor domain and then most likely, the system is sensing light indirectly. Intriguingly, this system inhibits blsA expression at 37 °C, suggesting antagonistic functioning of both signaling systems. Furthermore, we present evidence indicating that the phosphorylatable form of BfmR represses motility. Overall, we provide experimental evidence on a new biological function of this multifaceted system that broadens our understanding of A. baumannii's physiology and responses to light.	2023 Jan	Bárbara Perez Mora, Rocío Giordano, Valentín Permingeat, Malena Calderone, Natalia Arana, Gabriela Müller, Ramiro E Rodríguez, Renatas Krasauskas, María Alejandra Mussi	Sci Rep

35339024	An extensive computational study to identify potential inhibitors of Acyl-homoserine-lactone synthase from Acinetobacter baumannii (strain AYE).	A member of the ESKAPE family of pathogens, A. baumannii, is an opportunistic gram-negative multidrug-resistant bacterium. A. baumannii is a ubiquitous coccobacillus involved in various hospital-related infections such as wound infections, pneumonia, urinary tract infections, septicaemia, endocarditis and ventilator assisted pneumonia and accounts for approximately 1-2% of all nosocomial bloodstream infections; hence it becomes imperative to identify potential therapeutic agents against the dreadful pathogen. The quorum-sensing pathway becomes an attractive drug target due to its role in biofilm regulation and formation, which provides the bacteria insulation from the harsh environment. A crucial protein in biofilm formation and regulation is Acyl-homoserine-lactone synthase (AHLS), responsible for producing signal molecules that trigger the signalling pathway for biofilm formation and regulation. The current study modeled the three-dimensional structure of AHLS in A. baumannii (strain AYE) followed by high-throughput virtual screening of the enamine-AC small-molecule database to identify lead molecules against its acylated-ACP (Acyl Carrier Protein) substrate-binding site. Based on the estimated binding affinity, estimated inhibition constant, ADME analysis and interaction patterns of the screened molecules, three lead candidates (Z815888654, Z2416029019, Z3766992625) were identified along with a control molecule (J8-C8). These molecules were then subjected to molecular dynamics simulations where the physiological effect of ligand binding on the protein was virtually predicted and analysed. The MM/PBSA based binding free energy calculations showed favourable results for Z815888654 (-22.77 ± 2.94 kcal/mol), Z2416029019 (-33.68 ± 2.63 kcal/mol), Z3766992625 (-21.44 ± 3.40 kcal/mol). The study employed global and essential dynamics analyses, MM/PBSA based binding free energy, free energy landscape and dynamic cross-correlation matrix to suggest Z815888654, Z2416029019 and Z3766992625 as potential inhibitors against the acylated-ACP substrate-binding site in AHLS from A. baumannii.	2022 Jul	Rajat Kumar Jha, Rameez Jabeer Khan, Ekampreet Singh, Ankit Kumar, Monika Jain, Jayaraman Muthukumaran, Amit Kumar Singh	J Mol Graph Model
36566558	Aptamer-based DNA-catalyzed amplification strategy for sensitive fluorescence resonance energy transfer detection of Acinetobacter baumannii.	Acinetobacter baumannii (A. baumannii) is a common pathogen that causes hospital-acquired infections and is resistant to a wide variety of antibiotics. Consequently, the rapid and highly sensitive detection of A. baumannii is required during the early stages of infection. Therefore, we developed a DNA-catalyzed amplification mechanism based on aptamers, combined with a novel fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) method based on graphene oxide (GO), for the detection of A. baumannii. In the presence of A. baumannii, an aptamer bound to A. baumannii, releasing the template strand, which triggered an entropy-driven catalysis (EDC) reaction. One EDC product was then used as the catalyst for catalytic hairpin assembly (CHA) on a GO nanosheet. Finally, the GO released a huge amount of FAM-labeled DNA duplices, which could be detected with FRET. This strategy circumvented the extraction of nucleic acids and was easy to execute, with a detection time of ≤1.5 h. The detection of A. baumannii with this method ranges from 5 cfu/mL to 1 × 10<sup>5</sup> cfu/mL, with a detection limit of 1.1 cfu/mL. The method was sufficiently sensitive and specific to detect A. baumannii rapidly in cerebrospinal fluid. In summary, our strategy provides a new option for the early detection and point-of-care testing (POCT) of A. baumannii infections, allowing their earlier and more precise treatment.	2023 Apr	Jingling Xie, Hui Jiang, Yuanqing Zhao, Min Zhong, Xinrui Jin, Zixin Zhu, Baolin Li, Jinglan Guo, Limei Zhang, Jinbo Liu	Talanta

The Taguchi design was used to optimize the biodegradation of diesel using these bacteria as a consortium. The highest biodegradation of diesel-oil in the experimental tests was 93.6%, and the individual n-alkanes decomposed 87.6-97.6% over 30 days. Optimal settings were inoculum size of 2.5 mL (1.248 OD<sub>600nm</sub>); 12% (v/v) the initial diesel-oil in a minimal salt medium of pH 7.0, 30.0 gL<sup>-1</sup> NaCl and 2.0 gL<sup>-1</sup> NH<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>3</sub> concentration, incubated at 42 °C temperature and 150 rpm agitation speed. Parameters significantly improved diesel-oil removal by consortium as shown by the model determination coefficient (R<sup>2</sup> = 90.89%; <i>P</i> < 0.001) with a synergistic effect of agitation speed significantly contributing 81.03%. Taguchi design determined the optimal settings for the parameters under study, which significantly improved diesel-oil removal by consortium.

In this regard, while the advocated broth microdilution (BMD) method for colistin susceptibility testing is often considered cumbersome, the preferable colistin broth disk elution (CBDE) method has not yet been approved for A. baumannii. To prevent the underreporting of colistin susceptibility, we tested the CBDE method for A. baumannii and compared the results with those of BMD. A total of 125 A. baumannii, including 100 susceptible and 25 resistant isolates were tested via the CBDE method and compared with the standard BMD method. The essential agreement, categorical agreement, sensitivity, and specificity for CBDE were 97.6% (<i>n</i> = 122), 98.4% (<i>n</i> = 123), 100%, and 98.40%, respectively. The percentage of major error found was 1.6% (<i>n</i> = 2), and no very major error was found. CBDE in A. baumannii could be considered in low-resource settings. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> The relatively cumbersome broth microdilution (BMD) method for routine colistin susceptibility testing has not been adopted, especially in low-resource settings, often leading to the underreporting of colistin susceptibility and the promotion of the empirical use of colistin. In this regard, the much-preferred colistin broth disk elution (CBDE) method has not yet been approved for A. baumannii. We evaluated colistin susceptibility via the CBDE method, compared the results with those of the BMD method in 125 A. baumannii isolates with various profiles, and inferred that the CBDE method using 50 μL inoculum could be helpful, at least in resource-limited setups, versus not reporting susceptibility testing for colistin.	2022 Oct	Swati Sharma, Tuhina Banerjee, Rahul Garg, Padma Das	Microbiol Spectr

36817105	Galaxy ASIST: A web-based platform for mapping and assessment of global standards of antimicrobial susceptibility: A case study in <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> genomes.	Antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) is used to determine the susceptibility of an organism to antibiotics. The determination of susceptibility is based on MIC breakpoints and is provided by EUCAST and CLSI. Likewise, phenotypic classification criteria developed by CDC/ECDC are used for the classification of pathogens into susceptible, multidrug-resistant, extremely drug-resistant, or totally drug-resistant categories. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS)-based diagnosis is now supplementing existing gold-standard microbiology methods for rapid and more precise AST, and therefore, EUCAST recommended quality criteria to assess whole-genome sequence for reporting the same. In this study, these three global standards, MIC breakpoints, phenotypic classification, and genome quality, are applied to the largest publicly available data for Acinetobacter baumannii (AB), the most critical priority pathogen identified by WHO.	2022	Tina Sharma, Rakesh Kumar, Jasmeer Singh Kalra, Shreya Singh, Gurpreet Singh Bhalla, Anshu Bhardwaj	Front Microbiol
36338049	Effects of amikacin, polymyxin-B, and sulbactam combination on the pharmacodynamic indices of mutant selection against multi-drug resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>.	Amikacin and polymyxins as monotherapies are ineffective against multidrug-resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> at the clinical dose. When polymyxins, aminoglycosides, and sulbactam are co-administered, the combinations exhibit <i>in vitro</i> synergistic activities. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and mutant prevention concentration (MPC) were determined in 11 and 5 clinical resistant isolates of <i>A. baumannii</i> harboring OXA-23, respectively, in order to derive the fraction of time over the 24-h wherein the free drug concentration was within the mutant selection window (<i>f</i>T<sub>MSW</sub>) and the fraction of time that the free drug concentration was above the MPC (<i>f</i>T<sub>>MPC</sub>) from simulated pharmacokinetic profiles. The combination of these three antibiotics can confer susceptibility in multi-drug resistant <i>A. baumannii</i> and reduce the opportunity for bacteria to develop further resistance. Clinical intravenous dosing regimens of amikacin, polymyxin-B, and sulbactam were predicted to optimize <i>f</i>T<sub>MSW</sub> and <i>f</i>T<sub>>MPC</sub> from drug exposures in the blood. Mean <i>f</i>T<sub>>MPC</sub> were ≥ 60% and ≥ 80% for amikacin and polymyxin-B, whereas mean <i>f</i>T<sub>MSW</sub> was reduced to <30% and <15%, respectively, in the triple antibiotic combination. Due to the low free drug concentration of amikacin and polymyxin-B simulated in the epithelial lining fluid, the two predicted pharmacodynamic parameters in the lung after intravenous administration were not optimal even in the combination therapy setting.	2022	Shixing Zhu, Chu Song, Jiayuan Zhang, Shuo Diao, Tobias M Heinrichs, Frederico S Martins, Zhihua Lv, Yuanqi Zhu, Mingming Yu, Sherwin K B Sy	Front Microbiol
36188613	Emergence of high colistin resistance in carbapenem resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> in Pakistan and its potential management through immunomodulatory effect of an extract from <i>Saussurea lappa</i>.	Carbapenem resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> has emerged as one of the most difficult to treat nosocomial bacterial infections in recent years. It was one of the major causes of secondary infections in Covid-19 patients in developing countries. The polycationic polypeptide antibiotic colistin is used as a last resort drug to treat carbapenem resistant <i>A. baumannii</i> infections. Therefore, resistance to colistin is considered as a serious medical threat. The purpose of this study was to assess the current status of colistin resistance in Pakistan, a country where carbapenem resistant <i>A. bumannii</i> infections are endemic, to understand the impact of colistin resistance on virulence in mice and to assess alternative strategies to treat such infections. Out of 150 isolates collected from five hospitals in Pakistan during 2019-20, 84% were carbapenem resistant and 7.3% were additionally resistant to colistin. There were two isolates resistant to all tested antibiotics and 83% of colistin resistant isolates were susceptible to only tetracycline family drugs doxycycline and minocycline. Doxycycline exhibited a synergetic bactericidal effect with colistin even in colistin resistant isolates. Exposure of <i>A. baumannii</i> 17978 to sub inhibitory concentrations of colistin identified novel point mutations associated with colistin resistance. Colistin tolerance acquired independent of mutations in <i>lpxA, lpxB, lpxC</i>, <i>lpxD</i>, and <i>pmrAB</i> supressed the proinflammatory immune response in epithelial cells and the virulence in a mouse infection model. Moreover, the oral administration of water extract of <i>Saussuria lappa,</i> although not showing antimicrobial activity against <i>A. baumannii in vitro</i>, lowered the number of colonizing bacteria in liver, spleen and lung of the mouse model and also lowered the levels of neutrophils and interleukin 8 in mice. Our findings suggest that the <i>S. lappa</i> extract exhibits an immunomodulatory effect with potential to reduce and cure systemic infections by both opaque and translucent colony variants of <i>A. baumannii.</i>	2022	Umaira Ahsan, Fizza Mushtaq, Sidrah Saleem, Abdul Malik, Hira Sarfaraz, Muhammad Shahzad, Bernt Eric Uhlin, Irfan Ahmad	Front Pharmacol
35749272	Engineering Phage Tail Fiber Protein as a Wide-Spectrum Probe for <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> Strains with a Recognition Rate of 100.	As a multidrug-resistant pathogen, <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> has long been identified as one of the most common nosocomial bacteria. High-performance recognition probes for wide-spectrum detection of <i>A. baumannii</i> are highly desired to achieve efficient diagnosis and timely treatment of infectious diseases induced by this pathogen. An engineering tail fiber protein (ETFP) named as Gp50 encoded by lytic phage Abp9 was expressed in <i>Escherichia coli</i> and identified as a binding protein for <i>A. baumannii</i>. According to the results of genome sequencing of an <i>A. baumannii</i> wild strain and phage-resistant strains, the binding receptor of ETFP Gp50 is inferred to be a lipopolysaccharide distributed on the bacterial surface. The engineering protein did not show lytic activity to <i>A. baumannii</i>, which facilitates the development of reliable diagnosis kits and biosensors with high flexibility and low false-negative rate. The results of specificity study show that ETFP Gp50 is a species-specific binding protein with a recognition rate of 100% for all tested 77 <i>A. baumannii</i> strains, while that of the natural phage Abp9 is only 27.3%. With the engineering protein, a fluorescence method was developed to detect <i>A. baumannii</i> with a detection range of 2.0 × 10<sup>2</sup> to 2.0 × 10<sup>8</sup> cfu mL<sup>-1</sup>. The method has been used for the quantification of <i>A. baumannii</i> in a diverse sample matrix with acceptable reliability. The work demonstrates the application potential of ETFP Gp50 as an ideal recognition probe for rapid screening of <i>A. baumannii</i> strains in a complicated sample matrix.	2022 Jul	Ying Chen, Honglin Yang, Shuai Luo, Lin Wang, Shuguang Lu, Zhifeng Fu	Anal Chem

36361685	Rhamnetin, a Natural Flavonoid, Ameliorates Organ Damage in a Mouse Model of Carbapenem-Resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>-Induced Sepsis.	In sepsis, the persistence of uncontrolled inflammatory response of infected host cells eventually leads to severe lung and organ failure and, ultimately, death. Carbapenem-resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> (CRAB), causative bacteria of sepsis and lung failure in acute cases, belongs to a group of critical pathogens that cannot be eradicated using the currently available antibiotics. This underlines the necessity of developing new modes of therapeutics that can control sepsis at the initial stages. In this study, we investigated the anti-inflammatory activities in vitro and in vivo and the antiseptic effects of rhamnetin, a naturally occurring flavonoid. We found that among its isoforms, the potency of rhamnetin was less explored but rhamnetin possessed superior anti-inflammatory activity with least cytotoxicity. Rhamnetin showed significant anti-inflammatory effects in lipopolysaccharide-, CRAB-, and <i>Escherichia coli</i> (<i>E. coli</i>)-stimulated mouse macrophages by inhibiting the release of interleukin-6 and nitric oxide. In a mouse model of sepsis infected with clinically isolated CRAB or <i>E. coli</i>, rhamnetin significantly reduced the bacterial burden in the organs. In addition, normalized pro-inflammatory cytokine levels in lung lysates and histological analysis of lung tissue indicated alleviation of lung damage. This study implies that a potent natural product such as rhamnetin could be a future therapeutic for treating carbapenem-resistant gram-negative sepsis.	2022 Oct	Hyeju Lee, Manigandan Krishnan, Minju Kim, Young Kyung Yoon, Yangmee Kim	Int J Mol Sci
36307731	In vitro analysis of synergistic combination of polymyxin B with 12 other antibiotics against MDR Acinetobacter baumannii isolated from a Chinese tertiary hospital.	In clinical practice, polymyxins are suggested to be used in combination with other antibiotics for improving their antibacterial efficacy and preventing the emergency of antibiotic-resistant strains. However, even though synergistic combination of polymyxin B with many antibiotics have been confirmed in various studies with different bacterial species and analyzing methods, which antibiotic is the best option for combination therapy of polymyxin B against MDR A. baumannii remains uncertain. In this study, we systematically analyzed the synergistic combination of polymyxin B with 12 other antibiotics against MDR A. baumannii isolated from a Chinese tertiary hospital using the checkerboard assay. The results suggest that, for polymyxin B-based combination therapy against MDR A. baumannii as characterized in this hospital, cefperazone-sulbactam may be the best partner, since it has the highest synergistic rate and the best synergistic effect with polymyxin B. Minocycline, imipenem, meropenem, ceftazidime, cefepime, amikacin and sulfamethoxazole also have some synergistic effects with polymyxin B, but piperacillin-tazobactam, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and tobramycin show no synergism. None of these 12 antibiotics has an antagonistic effect when combined with polymyxin B.	2023 Jan	Hui Liu, Dan Hu, Dongxin Wang, Han Wu, Yunjun Pan, Xin Chen, Lin Qi, Lian Li, Rongxin Liang	J Antibiot (Tokyo)
36006253	Multicenter Study of the Risk Factors and Outcomes of Bloodstream Infections Caused by Carbapenem-Non-Susceptible <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> in Indonesia.	The prevalence of bacteremia caused by carbapenem-non-susceptible <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> (CNSAB) continues to increase, and it is associated with a high mortality rate. Early recognition of infection and mortality determinants risk factors is necessary for adequate antibiotic administration. We aimed to determine the risk factors and outcomes of CNSAB bacteremia in Indonesia. A multicenter case-control study was conducted in three referral hospitals in Indonesia. Data were collected retrospectively from January 2019 to December 2021. Cases were defined as patients with bacteremia where CNSAB was isolated from the blood, while the controls were patients with bacteremia caused by carbapenem-susceptible <i>A. baumannii</i> (CSAB). Risk factors for bacteremia and mortality associated with CNSAB bacteremia were determined using univariates analysis (chi-squared and Student's <i>t</i>-test or Mann-Whitney test) and multivariate logistic regression analysis. A total of 144 bacteremia patients were included, of whom 72 patients were for each case and control group. The final model of multivariate regression analysis revealed that bacteremia source from the lower respiratory tract (adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 3.24; 95% CI: 1.58-6.63, <i>p</i> = 0.001) and the use of central venous catheter (aOR: 2.56; 95% CI: 1.27-5.18; <i>p</i> = 0.009) were independent risk factors for CNSAB bacteremia. Charlson Comorbidity Index ≥ 4 (aOR: 28.56; 95% CI: 3.06-265.90, <i>p</i> = 0.003) and Pitt Bacteremia Score ≥ 4 (aOR: 6.44; 95% CI: 1.17-35.38; <i>p</i> = 0.032) were independent risk factors for mortality due to CNSAB bacteremia. Only high Pitt Bacteremia Score was an independent risk factor for mortality of CSAB bacteremia. In conclusion, we identified the risk factors for CNSAB-associated bacteremia and the risk factors for death, which are relevant for empiric therapy and infection control prevention, as well as prognosis evaluation of patients with bloodstream infections.	2022 Jul	Dewi Anggraini, Dewi Santosaningsih, Pepy Dwi Endraswari, Novira Jasmin, Fajri Marindra Siregar, Usman Hadi, Kuntaman Kuntaman	Trop Med Infect Dis
35352448	Mushroom-shaped structures formed in Acinetobacter baumannii biofilms grown in a roller bioreactor are associated with quorum sensing-dependent Csu-pilus assembly.	There is currently a need to develop simple biofilm models that facilitate investigation of the architecture/biology of mature bacterial biofilms in a consistent/standardized manner given their environmental and clinical importance and the need for new anti-biofilm interventions. This study introduces a novel biofilm culture system termed the rolling biofilm bioreactor (RBB). This easily operated system allows adherent microbial cells to be repeatedly exposed to air/solid/liquid interfaces optimizing biofilm growth. The RBB was exploited to investigate biofilm formation in Acinetobacter baumannii. High levels of A. baumannii biofilm biomass reproducibly accumulate in the RBB and, importantly, undergo a maturation step to form large mushroom-shaped structures that had not been observed in other models. Based on image analysis of biofilm development and genetic manipulation, we show how N-acylhomoserine lactone-dependent quorum sensing (QS) impacts on biofilm differentiation, composition and antibiotic tolerance. Our results indicate that extracellular DNA (eDNA) is a key matrix component in mature Acinetobacter biofilms as the mushroom-like structures consist of dense cellular masses encased in an eDNA mesh. Moreover, this study reveals the contribution of QS to A. baumannii biofilm differentiation through Csu pilus assembly regulation. Understanding the mechanisms of structural development of mature biofilms helps to identify new biofilm eradication and removal strategies.	2022 Sep	Manuel Romero, Celia Mayer, Stephan Heeb, Krittanont Wattanavaekin, Miguel Cámara, Ana Otero, Paul Williams	Environ Microbiol

36621329	Enhanced anti-biofilm activity of the minocycline-and-gallium-nitrate using niosome wrapping against Acinetobacter baumannii in C57/BL6 mouse pneumonia model.	Acinetobacter baumannii is a worldwide health issue in terms of its high antibiotic resistance and ability to form biofilms. Nanoparticles (NPs) with high biocompatibility, high penetrating ability, and low medication dose can successfully treat the antibiotic-resistant infections. In this research, the anti-biofilm activity of niosomes containing minocycline and gallium nitrate (GaN) against A. baumannii biofilm was determined. In order to improve their anti-biofilm properties, minocycline and GaN were encapsulated in niosomes as biocompatible drug carriers. The niosomes' size, zeta potential, shape, stability, drug entrapment efficacy, drug release pattern and antibacterial activity were assessed. Several clinical samples were isolated from the lungs of patients hospitalized at Loghman hospital, Tehran, Iran. The biofilm formation of most lethal clinical isolates of A. baumannii was analyzed. The pneumonia model was generated by intranasally administering A. baumannii suspension to anesthetized mice whose immune systems was compromised twice by cyclophosphamide. Lung infection of the mouse with A. baumannii was confirmed using PCR. After treatment, the lungs were excised under sterile conditions and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) to determine histological symptoms, inflammation and intercellular secretions. The niosomes contained minocycline and GaN had an average size of 230 nm and a zeta potential of -40 mV, respectively. The percentage of drug entrapment and delayed drug release was both high in niosomal formulations. Niosomes containing minocycline and GaN dispersed 1, 3 and 5 day old biofilms. The mice given the combination of two compounds required less time to be treated than the animals given the single medication (minocycline). The minocycline& GaN-loaded niosomes could be considered as promising candidates to treat the infections caused by A. baumannii biofilm.	2023 Feb	Farnaz Shamkani, Seyed Mahmoud Barzi, Farzad Badmasti, Mohsen Chiani, Esmat Mirabzadeh, Mahdi Zafari, Morvarid Shafiei	Int Immunopharmacol

36086811	Zinc oxide nanoparticles impact the expression of the genes involved in toxin-antitoxin systems in multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii.	The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO-NPs) on the expression of genes involved in toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems in multidrug-resistant (MDR) Acinetobacter baumannii. Seventy clinical isolates of A. baumannii were collected from variuos clinical samples. Antimicrobial susceptibility test was determined by disk diffusion. Type II TA system-related genes including GNAT, XRE-like, hipA, hipB, hicA, hicB were screened using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). ZnO-NPs prepared and characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction. MIC of ZnO-NPs of A. baumannii isolates was performed using the microdilution method. The expression of type II TA systems-related genes were assessed with and without exposure to ZnO-NPs using real-time PCR. The highest rate of resistance and sensitivity was observed against cefepime (77.14%), and ampicillin/sulbactam (42.85%), respectively. All A. baumannii isolates were considered as MDR. In this study, three TA loci were identified for A. baumannii including GNAT/XRE-like, HicA/HicB, and HipA/HipB and their prevalence was 100%, 42%, and 27.1%, respectively. There was no significant relationship between the prevalence of these systems and the origin of A. baumannii. Our data showed significant correlations between the presence of HicA/HicB system and resistance to ceftazidime, meropenem, imipenem, and cefepime (p < 0.05), and the presence of HipA/HipB system and resistance to ceftazidime, meropenem, imipenem, and cefepime (p < 0.05). In presence of ZnO-NPs, the expression of all studied genes decreased. GNAT and hicB showed the highest and lowest expression changes by 2.4 folds (p < 0.001) and 1.3 folds (p < 0.05), respectively. This study demonstrates the promising potential of nanoparticles to impact the expression of the genes involved in TA Systems. So, the application of ZnO-NPs may be helpful to design target-based strategies towards MDRs pathogens for empowered clinical applications by microbiologists and nanotechnologists.	2022 Sep	Shahla Shahbazi, Ali Shivaee, Marzieh Nasiri, Maryam Mirshekar, Samira Sabzi, Omid K Sariani	J Basic Microbiol

35669527	Dissemination and Genetic Relatedness of Multidrug-Resistant and Extensively Drug-Resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> Isolates from a Burn Hospital in Iraq.	<i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> is an aggressive opportunistic bacterial pathogen that causes severe nosocomial infections, especially among burn patients. An increasing number of hospitals-acquired infections have been reported all over the world. However, little attention has been paid to the relatedness between <i>A. baumannii</i> isolates from different hospital environments and patients. In this study, 27 isolates were collected from the Burn and Plastic Surgery Hospital of Al Sulaymaniyah City, Iraq, from January through December 2019 (11 from patients and 16 from the wards environment), identified to species level as <i>A. baumannii</i> using Vitek 2 system and molecular detection of <i>16S rRNA</i> gene, and then confirmed by targeting the <i>bla</i> <sub>OXA-51</sub> gene. Moreover, the isolates were characterized by means of automated antimicrobial susceptibility assay, antimicrobial-resistant patterns, a phenotypic method using a combined disk test, and molecular methods for the detection of class A and C <i>β</i>-lactamase genes, and finally, the genetic relatedness was classified. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing showed that 63% (17/27) of the retrieved <i>A. baumannii</i> isolates were extensively drug-resistant to 8/9 antimicrobial classes. Furthermore, 37% (10/27) of the isolates were classified as multidrug-resistant; 8 isolates exhibited similar resistant patterns and the other two isolates showed 2 different patterns, while resistance was greater in isolates from patients than from the ward environment. Combined disk test showed that two isolates contained extended-spectrum <i>β</i>-lactamase. All isolates carried <i>bla</i> <sub>TEM-1</sub>, and two copies of the <i>bla</i> <sub>CTX-1</sub> gene were indicated in one isolate, while <i>bla</i> <sub>SHV</sub> was absent in all isolates. Twenty-four isolates carried the <i>bla</i> <sub>AmpC</sub> gene; among them, 3 isolates harbored the insertion sequence IS<i>Aba-1</i> upstream to the gene. Using Enterobacterial Repetitive Intergenic Consensus PCR, the isolates were clustered into 6 distinct types; among them, two clusters, each of four strains, were classified to contain isolates from both patients and environments. The clusters of similar genotypes were found in inpatients as well as the environments of different wards during time periods, suggesting transmission within the hospital. Identification of possible infection sources and controlling the transmission of these aggressive resistance strains should be strictly conducted.	2022	Aras A K Shali, Paywast J Jalal, Sehand K Arif	Can J Infect Dis Med Microbiol
33856245	<i>Vibrio vulnificus</i>-Induced Necrotizing Fasciitis Complicated by Multidrug-Resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> Infection: Efficacy of Chemical Necrectomy Using 40% Benzoic Acid.	Necrotizing fasciitis is a life-threatening skin and soft tissue infection associated with high morbidity and mortality in adult patients. This infection can present as either type 1 infection caused by a mixed microflora (<i>Streptococci</i>, <i>Enterobacteriacae</i>, <i>Bacteroides</i> sp., and <i>Peptostreptococcus</i> sp.), most commonly developing in patients after surgery or in diabetic patients, or as type 2. The latter type is monomicrobial and, usually, caused by group A <i>Streptococci</i>. Rarely, this type can be also caused by other pathogens, such as <i>Vibrio vulnificus</i>. <i>V vulnificus</i> is a small mobile Gram-negative rod capable of causing 3 types of infections in humans-gastroenteritis, primary infection of the vascular bed, and wound infections. If infecting a wound, <i>V vulnificus</i> can cause a life-threatening condition-necrotizing fasciitis. We present a rare case of necrotizing fasciitis developing after an insect bite followed by exposure to the seawater. Rapid propagation of the infectious complication in the region of the right lower limb led to a serious consideration of the necessity of amputation. Due to the clearly demarcated necroses and secondary skin and soft tissue infection caused by a multiresistant strain of <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>, we, however, resorted to the use of selective chemical necrectomy using 40% benzoic acid-a unique application in this kind of condition. The chemical necrectomy was successful, relatively gentle and thanks to its selectivity, vital parts of the limb remained preserved and could have been subsequently salvaged at minimum blood loss. Moreover, the antimicrobial effect of benzoic acid led to rapid decolonization of the necrosis and wound bed preparation, which allowed us to perform defect closure using split-thickness skin grafts. The patient subsequently healed without further complications and returned to normal life.	2023 Mar	Bretislav Lipový, Radomir Mager, Filip Raška, Marketa Hanslianová, Josef Blažek, Hana Křemečková, Ivan Suchánek, Martin Hladík	Int J Low Extrem Wounds
37152898	Identification of fungus-growing termite-associated halogenated-PKS maduralactomycin a as a potential inhibitor of MurF protein of multidrug-resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>.	Multidrug-resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> infections have become a major public health concern globally. Inhibition of its essential MurF protein has been proposed as a potential target for broad-spectrum drugs. This study aimed to evaluate the potential of a novel ecological niche of 374 fungus-growing termite associated Natural Products (NPs). The molecular docking and computational pharmacokinetics screened four compounds, i.e., Termstrin B, Fridamycin A, Maduralactomycin A, and Natalenamide C, as potential compounds that have higher binding affinities and favourable protein-ligand interactions. The compound Maduralactomycin A induced more stability based on its lowest average RMSD value (2.31 Å) and low standard deviation (0.35) supported by the consistent flexibility and β-factor during the protein's time-dependent motion. While hydrogen bond analysis indicated that Termstrin B has formed the strongest intra-protein interaction, solvent accessibility was in good agreement with Maduralactomycin A compactness. Maduralactomycin A has the strongest binding energy among all the compounds (-348.48 kcal/mol) followed by Termstrin B (-321.19 kcal/mol). Since these findings suggest Maduralactomycin A and Termstrin B as promising candidates for inhibition of MurF protein, the favourable binding energies of Maduralactomycin A make it a more important compound to warrant further investigation. However, experimental validation using animal models and clinical trials is recommended before reaching any final conclusions.	2023	Muhammad Shoaib, Iram Shehzadi, Muhammad Umair Asif, Yulong Shen, Jinfeng Ni	Front Mol Biosci

36825087	Virulence potential of multidrug-resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> isolates from COVID-19 patients on mechanical ventilation: The first report from Serbia.	Since the WHO declared the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020, the disease has spread rapidly leading to overload of the health system and many of the patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 needed to be admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Around 10% of patients with the severe manifestation of COVID-19 need noninvasive or invasive mechanical ventilation, which represent a risk factor for <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> superinfection. The 64 <i>A. baumannii</i> isolates were recovered from COVID-19 patients admitted to ICU at General Hospital "Dr Laza K. Lazarević" Šabac, Serbia, during the period from December 2020 to February 2021. All patients required mechanical ventilation and mortality rate was 100%. The goal of this study was to evaluate antibiotic resistance profiles and virulence potential of <i>A. baumannii</i> isolates recovered from patients with severe form of COVID-19 who had a need for mechanical ventilation. All tested <i>A. baumannii</i> isolates (<i>n</i> = 64) were sensitive to colistin, while resistant to meropenem, imipenem, gentamicin, tobramycin, and levofloxacin according to the broth microdilution method and MDR phenotype was confirmed. In all tested isolates, representatives of international clone 2 (IC2) classified by multiplex PCR for clonal lineage identification, <i>bla</i> <sub>AmpC</sub>, <i>bla</i> <sub>OXA-51</sub>, and <i>bla</i> <sub>OXA-23</sub> genes were present, as well as IS<i>Aba1</i> insertion sequence upstream of <i>bla</i> <sub>OXA-23</sub>. Clonal distribution of one dominant strain was found, but individual strains showed phenotypic differences in the level of antibiotic resistance, biofilm formation, and binding to mucin and motility. According to PFGE, four isolates were sequenced and antibiotic resistance genes as well as virulence factors genes were analyzed in these genomes. The results of this study represent the first report on virulence potential of MDR <i>A. baumannii</i> from hospital in Serbia.	2023	Katarina Novović, Snežana Kuzmanović Nedeljković, Mirjana Poledica, Gordana Nikolić, Bojana Grujić, Branko Jovčić, Milan Kojić, Brankica Filipić	Front Microbiol

Acinetobacter baumannii is a significant opportunistic pathogen causing nosocomial infections. Infections caused by A. baumannii are often difficult to treat because this bacterium is often multidrug-resistant and shows high environmental adaptability. Here, we report on the analysis of three A. baumannii strains isolated from hospital effluents in South Africa.	2022 Dec	Emmanuel C Eze, Linda Falgenhauer, Mohamed E El Zowalaty	J Glob Antimicrob Resist
36047802	A <i>pyrF</i>-Based Efficient Genetic Manipulation Platform in Acinetobacter baumannii To Explore the Vital DNA Components of Adaptive Immunity for I-F CRISPR-Cas.	Acinetobacter baumannii is an important pathogenic bacterium with multidrug resistance which causes infections with high mortality rates. In-depth genetic analysis of A. baumannii virulence and drug-resistant genes is highly desirable. In this study, we utilized the conserved <i>pyrF</i>-flanking fragment to rapidly generate uracil auxotrophy hosts with <i>pyrF</i> deleted in model and clinical A. baumannii strains and then introduced the <i>pyrF</i> gene as the selectable and counterselectable marker to establish a series of gene manipulation vectors. For gene deletion with the suicide <i>pyrF</i>-based plasmid, the second-crossover colonies screened with the <i>pyrF</i>/5-fluoroorotic acid (5-FOA) system were obtained more quickly and efficiently than those screened with the <i>sacB</i>/sucrose system. By using the replicative plasmid, the recognized protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM) bias for type I-F CRISPR was experimentally revealed in A. baumannii AYE. Interestingly, interference recognized only the PAM-CC sequence, whereas adaptation priming tolerates 4 PAM sequences. Furthermore, we also performed a rapid and extensive modification of the I-F CRISPR-Cas elements and revealed that the role of double-nucleotide sequence mutants at the end of the repeat could be critical during both CRISPR interference and priming; we also found strong biases for A and demonstrated that adaptation could tolerate certain sequence and size variations of the leader in A. baumannii. In conclusion, this <i>pyrF</i>-based genetic manipulation system was readily applicable and efficient for exploring the genetic characteristics of A. baumannii. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> In this study, we developed the widely applicable and efficient <i>pyrF</i>-based selection and counterselection system in A. baumannii for gene manipulation. In most cases, this <i>pyrF</i>/5-FOA genetic manipulation system was very effective and enabled us to obtain marker-free mutants in a very short period of time. Utilizing this system and the separate mechanism of interference and/or primed adaptation, our experiments revealed some recognition mechanism differences for the key DNA elements of PAM, leader, and repeat in the priming adaptation process of the I-F CRISPR-Cas systems of A. baumannii, which provided some new and original insights for the study of the molecular mechanisms of these processes and laid a foundation for further studies.	2022 Oct	Shuqi Wu, Run Xu, Mengjiao Su, Can Gao, Yang Liu, Yujia Chen, Guangxin Luan, Xu Jia, Rui Wang	Microbiol Spectr

35855908	Insights into mobile genetic elements and the role of conjugative plasmid in transferring aminoglycoside resistance in extensively drug-resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> AB329.	<i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> is a major cause of nosocomial infection, and the incidence of extensively drug-resistant <i>A. baumannii</i> (XDRAB) infections has dramatically increased worldwide. In this study, we aimed to explore the complete genome sequence of XDRAB 329, ST1166/98 (Oxford/Pasteur), which is an outbreak clone from a hospital in Thailand. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) was performed using short-read Illumina and long-read PacBio sequencing, and a conjugation assay of its plasmid was performed. The complete genome sequence of <i>A. baumannii</i> AB329 revealed a circular chromosome 3,948,038 bp in length with 39% GC content. Antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), including beta-lactam resistance (<i>bla</i> <sub>OXA-51</sub>, <i>bla</i> <sub>ADC-25</sub>, <i>bla</i> <sub>OXA-23</sub>, <i>bla</i> <sub>TEM-1D)</sub>, aminoglycoside resistance (<i>aph(3')</i>-Ia, <i>aph</i>(3″)-Ib, <i>aph</i>(6)-Id, <i>arm</i>A), tetracycline resistance (<i>tet</i>(B), <i>tet</i> (R)), macrolide resistance (<i>mph</i>(E), <i>msr</i>(E)), and efflux pumps, were found. Mobile genetic elements (MGEs) analysis of <i>A. baumannii</i> AB329 revealed two plasmids (pAB329a and pAB329b), three prophages, 19 genomic islands (GIs), and 33 insertion sequences (ISs). pAB329a is a small circular plasmid of 8,731 bp, and pAB329b is a megaplasmid of 82,120 bp. <i>aph</i>(3')-VIa was detected in pAB329b, and a major facilitator superfamily (MFS) transporter was detected in the prophage<i>. Acinetobacter baumannii</i> resistance island 4 (AbaR4) harboring tetracycline and aminoglycoside resistance was detected in the genome of <i>A. baumannii</i> AB329. pAB329b, which belongs to Rep-type GR6 (plasmid lineage LN_1), is a conjugative plasmid with the ability to transfer an aminoglycoside resistance gene to sodium azide-resistant <i>A. baumannii.</i> This study provides insights into the features of the MGEs of XDRAB<i>,</i> which are the main reservoir and source of dissemination of ARGs.	2022	Supat Khongfak, Rapee Thummeepak, Udomluk Leungtongkam, Kannipa Tasanapak, Aunchalee Thanwisai, Sutthirat Sitthisak	PeerJ
35736241	Bactericidal Synergism between Phage YC#06 and Antibiotics: a Combination Strategy to Target Multidrug-Resistant Acinetobacter baumannii <i>In Vitro</i> and <i>In Vivo</i>.	Phage-antibiotic combination (PAC) therapy is a potential new alternative to treat infections caused by pathogenic bacteria, particularly those caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria. In the present study, phage YC#06 against highly multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii 4015 was isolated, identified, and characterized. Compared with antibiotics alone, the time-kill experiments <i>in vitro</i> showed that YC#06 and antibiotic mixtures that include the chloramphenicol, imipenem, and cefotaxime combination could produce phage-antibiotic synergy (PAS), which reduced the ultimate effective concentration of antibiotics. No phage-resistant bacteria have been isolated during the whole time-kill experiments <i>in vitro</i>. Of note, PAS was dose dependent, requiring a moderate phage dose to achieve maximum PAS effect. In addition, PAS could effectively inhibit biofilm formation and remove mature biofilms <i>in vitro</i>. Furthermore, PAS between the combination of YC#06 and antibiotic mixtures <i>in vivo</i> was validated using a zebrafish infection model. Overall, the results of this study demonstrate that PAC could be a viable strategy to treat infection caused by high-level multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii or other drug-resistant bacteria through switching to other types of phage and antibiotic mixtures. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> The treatment of multidrug-resistant bacterial infection is an urgent clinical problem. The combination of bacteriophages and antibiotics could produce synergistic bactericidal effects, which could reduce the emergence of antibiotic resistance and antibiotic consumption in antibiotic-sensitive bacteria, restore efficacy to antibiotics in antibiotic-resistant bacteria, and prevent the occurrence of phage-resistant bacteria. Phage-antibiotic combination (PAC) might be a potential new alternative for clinical treatment of multidrug-resistant bacterial infections.	2022 Aug	Jun Luo, Libo Xie, Min Liu, Qianyuan Li, Peng Wang, Chunhua Luo	Microbiol Spectr
36534485	Reservoir of Carbapenem-Resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> in the Hospital Environment and Colonization Pressure: A Surveillance-Based Study in Indian Intensive Care Unit.	The endemicity of <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> in intensive care units (ICUs) is a serious concern. We studied the reservoirs of <i>A. baumannii</i> in the ICU and their effects on colonization pressure and transmission. A prospective surveillance (6 months) was conducted. Screening culture (rectal and axillary) swabs were collected within 48 hours admission and in 120 hours. Surveillance cultures from patients' surroundings, health care workers (HCWs), and hospital sewage were collected. <i>A. baumannii</i> was identified by phenotypic and genotypic methods. Carbapenem resistance and insertion sequence element were detected. Typing was done by repetitive extragenic palindromic-polymerase chain reaction and multilocus sequence typing. Colonization pressure was calculated and compared with environment colonizers. Of the 87 patients, 21.83% (19) were colonized with <i>A. baumannii</i>, 73.68% (14/19) were imported, and 26.31% (5/19) acquired carriers. Axilla was the commonest site. From the environment (15), bed rails 33.33% (5/15) and suction tubes 26.66% (4/15) were the common sites. HCWs showed 7.5% (3/40) carriage. Carbapenem resistance with <i>bla</i><sub>OXA-51</sub>, <i>bla</i><sub>OXA-23</sub>, and IS<i>Aba1</i> were 91.89% (34/37). Strong correlation between colonization pressures and environmental colonizers was seen (<i>r</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.719, <i>p</i> = 0.032). Carbapenem and polymyxin B were (<i>p</i> ≤ 0.05) significant exposures. Sequence type 623 was the predominant cluster with isolates from carriers, HCWs, and environment. Colonization pressure of carbapenem-resistant <i>A. baumannii</i> depends on their presence in the hospital. Hands of HCWs were an important vehicle for transmission. Infection control measure should consider reducing the environmental reservoir.	2022 Dec	Swati Sharma, Arghya Das, Rahul Garg, Sangita Pramanik, Pooja Marndi, Ravindra Singh, Tuhina Banerjee, Ghanshyam Yadav, Ashok Kumar	Microb Drug Resist
36534183	Investigation of the synergistic effect of glycolipid biosurfactant produced by Shewanella algae with some antibiotics against planktonic and biofilm forms of MRSA and antibiotic resistant Acinetobacter baumannii.	To tackling antibiotic resistance and the appearance of multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains, one current approach is the combined use of biosurfactants with antibiotics to increase their efficacy. The antimicrobial ability of biosurfactant produced by Shewanella algae strain B12 was examined using the agar well diffusion method versus some resistant Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. The Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) of Glycolipid-Biosurfactant of B12 (GBB12) was performed by the broth dilution technique. The inhibition of biofilm formation, disruption of biofilm, and reducing the population of viable cells in biofilm were evaluated by the microtiter plate method. Finally, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) analysis was used to confirm the disruption of the cell membrane by GBB12. In all experiments, when GBB12 was added to antibiotics (except Amikacin), the antimicrobial activity was increased. The synergistic effects of GBB12 and antibiotics (Ciprofloxacin and Gentamycin) against Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Acinetobacter baumannii were confirmed by the Fractional Inhibitory Concentration Index (FICI). GBB12-Gentamycin mixture almost completely inhibits the formation of A. baumannii biofilm, reaching 99.8% inhibition. Also, the rate of MRSA biofilm inhibition treated with GBB12-Ciprofloxacin mixture was found to be 99.4%. biosurfactant-antibiotic mixture could be adequate replacements for traditional antibiotics in the near future. This study shows the potential of GBB12 as antimicrobial and antibiofilm agent.	2022 Dec	Nazanin Amirinejad, Poorandokht Shahriary, Mehdi Hassanshahian	World J Microbiol Biotechnol
36139979	In Vitro and In Vivo Antimicrobial Activity of the Novel Peptide OMN6 against Multidrug-Resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>.	The rapid worldwide spread of antimicrobial resistance highlights the significant need for the development of innovative treatments to fight multidrug-resistant bacteria. This study describes the potent antimicrobial activity of the novel peptide OMN6 against a wide array of drug-resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> clinical isolates. OMN6 prevented the growth of all tested isolates, regardless of any pre-existing resistance mechanisms. Moreover, in vitro serial-passaging studies demonstrated that no resistance developed against OMN6. Importantly, OMN6 was highly efficacious in treating animal models of lung and blood infections caused by multidrug-resistant <i>A. baumannii</i>. Taken together, these results point to OMN6 as a novel antimicrobial agent with the potential to treat life-threatening infections caused by multidrug-resistant <i>A. baumannii</i> avoiding resistance.	2022 Sep	Janna Michaeli, Shira Mandel, Shelly Maximov, Jonathan Zazoun, Paola Savoia, Nimmi Kothari, Thomas Valmont, Livia Ferrari, Leonard R Duncan, Stephen Hawser, Moshe Cohen-Kutner, Niv Bachnoff	Antibiotics (Basel)
35985003	Multilocus Sequence Typing of Carbapenem-Resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> Isolates Harboring <i>bla</i><sub>OXA-23</sub> and <i>bla</i><sub>IMP</sub> in Cattle from Punjab, Pakistan.	<i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> is a notorious bacterial pathogen that can cause an array of nosocomial infections in clinical settings. However, the data from the veterinary settings is limited and especially in Pakistan, no such study is conducted so far. To investigate the prevalence, antimicrobial resistance, and distribution of specific sequence types of <i>A. baumannii</i> in cattle, a total of 1,960 samples were collected from cattle over 18 months from Punjab, Pakistan. The isolates obtained were identified using the API20NE system and confirmed through PCR. The isolated <i>A. baumannii</i> isolates were further screened for antimicrobial susceptibility and the presence of resistance genes. Multilocus sequence typing was carried out to characterize the carbapenem-resistant <i>A. baumannii</i> (CRAB) isolates. Results revealed an overall prevalence of <i>A. baumannii</i> at 3.31% (65/1,960) with a higher prevalence of 7.38% (54/731) in dairy cattle compared to beef cattle at 4.41% (11/249). Among 65 <i>A. baumannii</i> isolates, 27.7% (18/65) were CRAB. All CRAB isolates harbor class D β-lactamases genes <i>bla</i><sub>OXA-23</sub> and <i>bla</i><sub>OXA-51,</sub> whereas 94.4% (17/18) CRAB isolates carried class B β-lactamases gene <i>bla</i><sub>IMP,</sub> and only one isolate had <i>bla</i><sub>NDM-1</sub> gene. The commonly found sequence types for CRAB isolates were ST2 and ST642 corresponding to 10 and 05 isolates, respectively. The presence of CRAB in cattle indicates an alarming situation that necessitates an urgent and efficient surveillance system to limit the transmission of CRAB among the cattle population and its possible transmission to humans and the environment.	2022 Oct	Minhas Alam, Muhammad Hidayat Rasool, Iahtasham Khan, Mohsin Khurshid, Bilal Aslam	Microb Drug Resist
35736874	Alert Germ Infections: Chest X-ray and CT Findings in Hospitalized Patients Affected by Multidrug-Resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> Pneumonia.	Acinetobacter baumannii (Ab) is an opportunistic Gram-negative pathogen intrinsically resistant to many antimicrobials. The aim of this retrospective study was to describe the imaging features on chest X-ray (CXR) and computed tomography (CT) scans in hospitalized patients with multidrug-resistant (MDR) Ab pneumonia. CXR and CT findings were graded on a three-point scale: 1 represents normal attenuation, 2 represents ground-glass attenuation, and 3 represents consolidation. For each lung zone, with a total of six lung zones in each patient, the extent of disease was graded using a five-point scale: 0, no involvement; 1, involving 25% of the zone; 2, 25−50%; 3, 50−75%; and 4, involving >75% of the zone. Points from all zones were added for a final total cumulative score ranging from 0 to 72. Among 94 patients who tested positive for MDR Ab and underwent CXR (males 52.9%, females 47.1%; mean age 64.2 years; range 1−90 years), 68 patients underwent both CXR and chest CT examinations. The percentage of patients with a positive CT score was significantly higher than that obtained on CXR (67.65% > 35.94%, p-value = 0.00258). CT score (21.88 ± 15.77) was significantly (p-value = 0.0014) higher than CXR score (15.06 ± 18.29). CXR and CT revealed prevalent bilateral abnormal findings mainly located in the inferior and middle zones of the lungs. They primarily consisted of peripheral ground-glass opacities and consolidations which predominated on CXR and CT, respectively.	2022 Jun	Raffaella Capasso, Antonio Pinto, Nicola Serra, Umberto Atripaldi, Adele Corcione, Giorgio Bocchini, Salvatore Guarino, Roberta Lieto, Gaetano Rea, Giacomo Sica, Tullio Valente	Tomography
37192494	Tigecycline-Containing Regimens and Multi Drug-Resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.	<b><i>Introduction:</i></b> The use of tigecycline (TG) for the treatment of <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> is controversial. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we aimed to better explore the safety and efficacy of TG for the treatment of multi drug-resistant (MDR) Acinetobacter. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> We searched PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, Cochrane Central, and Web of Science to identify studies reporting the clinical and microbiological efficacy and safety of regimens containing TG in patients with drug susceptibility testing (DST)-confirmed MDR <i>A. baumannii</i>, published until December 30, 2022. Observational studies were included if they reported clinical and microbiological efficacy of TG-based regimens. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) and Joana Briggs Institute (JBI) critical appraisal tool were used to assess the quality of included studies. <b><i>Results:</i></b> There were 30 observational studies, of which 19 studies were cohort and 11 studies were single group studies. Pooled clinical response and failure rates in the TG-containing regimens group were 58.1 (95% confidence interval [CI] 49.2-66.6) and 40.2 (95% CI 31.1-50.0), respectively. The pooled microbiological response rate was 32.1 (95% CI 19.8-47.5), and the pooled all-cause mortality rate was 41.1 (95% CI 34.1-48.4). Pooled clinical response and failure rates in the colistin-based regimens group were 52.7 (42.7-62.5) and 43.1 (33.1-53.8), respectively. The pooled microbiological response rate was 42.9 (16.2-74.5), and the pooled all-cause mortality rate was 34.3 (26.1-43.5). <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> According to our results, the efficacy of the TG-based regimen is the same as other antibiotics. However, our study showed a high mortality rate and a lower rate of microbiological eradication for TG compared with colistin-based regimen. Therefore, our study does not recommend it for the treatment of MDR <i>A. baumannii</i>. However, this was a prevalence meta-analysis of observational studies, and for better conclusion experimental studies are required.	2023 May	Fatemeh Sodeifian, Moein Zangiabadian, Erfan Arabpour, Naghmeh Kian, Fartous Yazarlou, Mehdi Goudarzi, Rosella Centis, Zahra Sadat Seghatoleslami, Mahdis Chahar Kameh, Bardia Danaei, Hossein Goudarzi, Mohammad Javad Nasiri, Giovanni Sotgiu, Giovanni Battista Migliori	Microb Drug Resist
37063277	Effect of traditional Chinese medicine monomers interfering with quorum-sensing on virulence factors of extensively drug-resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>.	The antimicrobial resistance of <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> (<i>A. baumannii</i>) clinical isolates has emerged as a great threat to public health. Quorum sensing (QS) is one of the resistance mechanisms for drug-resistant <i>A. baumannii</i>. Interfering with QS is a promising strategy to combat infections caused by drug-resistant bacteria. This study explored the QS inhibition ability of thirty-four traditional Chinese medicine monomers (TCMMs) and assessed the effect of QS inhibitors (QSIs) on the virulence factors of twelve extensively drug-resistant <i>A. baumannii</i> (XDRAB) strains. Nine traditional Chinese medicine monomers, such as caffeic acid, cinnamic acid, and myricetin, were found to be able to inhibit the bacterial QS. Then, at 1/8 of the minimal inhibitory concentration, we found that these QSIs inhibited extensively drug-resistant <i>A. baumannii</i> adhesion and biofilm formation and downregulated the expression levels of virulence-associated genes (<i>abaI, abaR, csuE, pgaA</i>, and <i>bap</i>). In conclusion, nine traditional Chinese medicine monomers have QS inhibitory activity and may downregulate QS genes to interfere with the QS system, which could inhibit the expression of extensively drug-resistant <i>A. baumannii</i> virulence factors. These results suggest that traditional Chinese medicine monomers could develop as novel anti-virulence compounds to control extensively drug-resistant <i>A. baumannii</i> infections.	2023	Li Zeng, Fei Lin, Baodong Ling	Front Pharmacol
36992253	Using an Aluminum Hydroxide-Chitosan Matrix Increased the Vaccine Potential and Immune Response of Mice against Multi-Drug-Resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>.	<i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> is a Gram-negative, immobile, aerobic nosocomial opportunistic coccobacillus that causes pneumonia, septicemia, and urinary tract infections in immunosuppressed patients. There are no commercially available alternative antimicrobials, and multi-drug resistance is an urgent concern that requires emergency measures and new therapeutic strategies. This study evaluated a multi-drug-resistant <i>A. baumannii</i> whole-cell vaccine, inactivated and adsorbed on an aluminum hydroxide-chitosan (mAhC) matrix, in an <i>A. baumannii</i> sepsis model in immunosuppressed mice by cyclophosphamide (CY). CY-treated mice were divided into immunized, non-immunized, and adjuvant-inoculated groups. Three vaccine doses were given at 0D, 14D, and 28D, followed by a lethal dose of 4.0 × 10<sup>8</sup> CFU/mL of <i>A. baumannii</i>. Immunized CY-treated mice underwent a significant humoral response, with the highest IgG levels and a higher survival rate (85%); this differed from the non-immunized CY-treated mice, none of whom survived (<i>p</i> < 0.001), and from the adjuvant group, with 45% survival (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Histological data revealed the evident expansion of white spleen pulp from immunized CY-treated mice, whereas, in non-immunized and adjuvanted CY-treated mice, there was more significant organ tissue damage. Our results confirmed the proof-of-concept of the immune response and vaccine protection in a sepsis model in CY-treated mice, contributing to the advancement of new alternatives for protection against <i>A. baumannii</i> infections.	2023 Mar	Túllio T Deusdará, Mellanie K C Félix, Helio de S Brito, Edson W S Cangussu, Wellington de S Moura, Benedito Albuquerque, Marcos G Silva, Gil R Dos Santos, Paula B de Morais, Elizangela F da Silva, Yury O Chaves, Luis Andre M Mariúba, Paulo A Nogueira, Spartaco Astolfi-Filho, Enedina N Assunção, Sabrina Epiphanio, Claudio R F Marinho, Igor V Brandi, Kelvinson F Viana, Eugenio E Oliveira, Alex Sander R Cangussu	Vaccines (Basel)
36833021	The Impact of Multidrug-Resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> Infection in Critically Ill Patients with or without COVID-19 Infection.	This is a single-center, retrospective, cohort study aimed to evaluate the clinical outcomes of multi-drug resistance in <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> infections (MDR-AB) in intensive care unit (ICU) patients with or without a COVID-19 infection and risk factors for blood stream infection. A total of 170 patients with MDR-AB were enrolled in the study. Of these, 118 (70%) patients were admitted to the ICU due to a COVID-19 infection. Comparing the COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 groups, the use of mechanical ventilation (98.31% vs. 76.92%, <i>p</i> = 0.000), the presence of septic shock (96.61% vs. 82.69%, <i>p</i> = 0.002), and the use of steroid (99.15% vs. 71.15%, <i>p</i> = 0.000) and tocilizumab therapies (33.05% vs. 0%, <i>p</i> = 0.000) were more prevalent and statistically more significant in patients with COVID-19 infections. The average length of the ICU stay (21.2 vs. 28.33, <i>p</i> = 0.0042) was significantly lower in patients with COVID-19 infections. Survival rate was 21.19% for the COVID-19 group and 28.85% for non-COVID-19 group with a <i>p</i>-value = 0.0361. COVID-19 status was associated with significantly higher hazards of death (HR 1.79, CI 95% 1.02-3.15, <i>p</i> = 0.043). Higher SOFAB (15.07 vs. 12.07, <i>p</i> = 0.0032) and the placement of an intravascular device (97.06% vs. 89.71%, <i>p</i> = 0.046) were significantly associated with the development of a bloodstream infection.

36599842	The prevalence, presentation and outcome of colistin susceptible-only Acinetobacter Baumannii-associated pneumonia in intensive care unit: a multicenter observational study.	Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) caused by carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB) are both associated with significant morbidity and mortality in daily clinical practice, as well as in a critical care setting. It is unclear whether colistin susceptible-only Acinetobacter baumannii (CSO AB) is a unique phenotype separate from or a subset of CRAB-associated pneumonia. The aim of this study is to investigate the prevalence of CSO AB pneumonia and compare the presentation and outcome between CSO AB and CRAB-associated pneumonia in critically ill patients. This multicenter retrospective cohort study initially recruited 955 patients with CR-GNB pneumonia. After exclusion, 575 patients left who were ICU-admitted and had CRAB nosocomial pneumonia remained. Among them, 79 patients had CSO AB pneumonia, classified as the CSO AB group. The other 496 patients were classified as the CRAB group. We compared demographic characteristics, disease severity, and treatment outcomes between the two groups. The prevalence of CSO AB among all cases of CRAB pneumonia was 13.74% (79/575). The CSO AB and CRAB groups had similar demographic characteristics and disease severities at initial presentation. The in-hospital mortality rate was 45.6% and 46.4% for CSO AB and CRAB groups, respectively (p = 0.991). The CSO AB group had significantly better clinical outcomes at day 7 (65.8% vs 52.4%, p = 0.036) but longer length of ICU stay (27 days vs 19 days, p = 0.043) compared to the CRAB group. However, other treatment outcomes, including clinical outcomes at day 14 and 28, mortality, microbiological eradication, ventilator weaning, and newly onset dialysis, were similar. In conclusion, CSO AB accounted for 13.74% of all cases of CRAB pneumonia, and the clinical presentation and treatment outcomes of CSO AB and CRAB pneumonia were similar.	2023 Jan	Sheng-Huei Wang, Kuang-Yao Yang, Chau-Chyun Sheu, Yu-Chao Lin, Ming-Cheng Chan, Jia-Yih Feng, Chia-Min Chen, Chih-Yu Chen, Zhe-Rong Zheng, Yu-Ching Chou, Chung-Kan Peng	Sci Rep

35910596	Replacement of the Dominant ST191 Clone by ST369 Among Carbapenem-Resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> Bloodstream Isolates at a Tertiary Care Hospital in South Korea.	The clonal dissemination of carbapenem-resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> (CRAB) bacteremia is a serious clinical problem worldwide. However, the factors related to the emergence and replacement of predominant CRAB clones in nosocomial settings are unclear. By multilocus sequence typing (MLST), we evaluated the genetic relatedness of CRAB bloodstream isolates at a tertiary care hospital over a 3.5-year period and investigated the clinical and microbiologic characteristics of the predominant sequence types (STs). One hundred and seventy-nine CRAB bloodstream isolates were collected from June 2016 to December 2019, and their MLSTs according to Oxford scheme and clinical data were obtained. The predominant STs were assessed for <i>in vitro</i> growth, competitive growth, and virulence in a mouse model of intraperitoneal infection. Two dominant clones-ST369 (<i>n</i> = 98) and ST191 (<i>n</i> = 48)-belonging to international clone 2 (IC2) were recovered from patients admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) or wards. ST191 predominated (61%, 27/43) from June 2016 to July 2017, whereas ST369 (72%, 98/136), which was first isolated from a patient admitted to the emergency room, replaced ST191 (15%, 21/136) after August 2017. In a multivariate analysis, leukopenia (OR = 3.62, 95% CI 1.04-12.6, <i>p</i> = 0.04) and ST191 or 369 (OR = 5.32, 95% CI 1.25-22.65, <i>p</i> = 0.02) were independent risk factors for 7-day mortality. Compared with non-ST369, ST369 was associated with a shorter time to bacteremia from ICU admission (7 vs. 11 days, <i>p</i> = 0.01), pneumonia as an origin of bacteremia (67 vs. 52%, <i>p</i> = 0.04), leukopenia (28 vs. 11%, <i>p</i> < 0.01), and a lower 7-day survival rate (41 vs. 70%, <i>p</i> < 0.01). <i>In vitro</i>, ST 369 isolates had significantly higher growth rates and enhanced competitive growth compared to ST191. Finally, ST369 had greater virulence and a higher mortality rate than other STs in a mouse infection model. We report almost-complete replacement of the predominant ST191 clone by ST369 within an 8-month period at our hospital. ST369 had a high incidence density rate of CRAB bacteremia, a short time to bacteremia after ICU admission, and a high early mortality rate, which may be in part explained by its faster competitive growth rate and higher virulence than ST191.	2022	Seong Eun Kim, Su-Mi Choi, Yohan Yu, Sung Un Shin, Tae Hoon Oh, Seung-Ji Kang, Kyung-Hwa Park, Jong Hee Shin, Uh Jin Kim, Sook In Jung	Front Microbiol
35844614	<i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> Outer Membrane Protein A Induces Pulmonary Epithelial Barrier Dysfunction and Bacterial Translocation Through The TLR2/IQGAP1 Axis.	Pulmonary epithelial barrier dysfunction is a critical pathophysiological process in pneumonia and associated invasive infections, such as those caused by <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>. However, the mechanisms underlying <i>A. baumannii</i>-induced pulmonary epithelial barrier dysfunction and bacterial translocation remain unclear. In this study, lungs of mice and A549 human epithelial cell monolayers were challenged with the <i>A. baumannii</i> wild-type strain and an outer membrane protein A (<i>ompA</i>) deletion strain. In addition, epithelial cells in culture were treated with purified OmpA protein or transfected with a eukaryotic expression vector encoding <i>ompA</i> (pCMV-<i>ompA</i>). Bacterial translocation across cell monolayers and intrapulmonary burden were measured, barrier function was evaluated <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i>; cell migration ability was determined. The specific inhibitors C29 and JSH-23 were used to suppress the activity of Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) and of NF-κB, respectively. IQ-GTPase-activating protein 1 (IQGAP1) small interfering RNA was used to knock down endogenous IQGAP1 expression. In this work, we show that OmpA from <i>A. baumannii</i> increased the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, remodeled the cytoskeleton, and internalized intercellular adherens junctions (AJs); these changes eventually induced pulmonary epithelial barrier dysfunction to promote bacterial translocation. IQGAP1-targeting small interfering RNA and chemical inhibition of TLR2 or NF-κB prevented high permeability of the pulmonary epithelial barrier. TLR2/NF-κB signaling was involved in OmpA-induced inflammation, IQGAP1-mediated OmpA-induced opening of the pulmonary epithelial barrier <i>via</i> cytoskeleton dynamic remodeling, and cellular redistribution of the major AJ protein, E-cadherin. These observations indicate that <i>A. baumannii</i> uses OmpA to overcome epithelial defences and cross the pulmonary epithelial barrier.	2022	Wang Zhang, Hua Zhou, Yan Jiang, Jintao He, Yue Yao, Jianfeng Wang, Xiaochen Liu, Sebastian Leptihn, Xiaoting Hua, Yunsong Yu	Front Immunol

35834022	Investigating Biofilm Formation and Antibiofilm Activity Using Real Time Cell Analysis Method in Carbapenem Resistant Acinetobacter baumannii Strains.	Acinetobacter baumannii is a significant nosocomial pathogen, with its biofilm forming capacity playing an important role in its pathogenicity. The fast and reliable detection of the biofilm formation and measurement of antibiofilm activity of various molecules are critical for combating A. baumannii infections. In this study, we aimed to detect biofilm formation by real time cell analyses (RTCA) method in clinical A. baumannii isolates and to investigate antibiofilm activities of tigecycline (TGC), N-acetylcysteine (NAC), and acetylsalicylic acid (ASA). The effect of the tested drugs on expressions of biofilm-related genes bap and csuE in clinical A. baumannii strains was also analyzed by real time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Biofilm forming capacities for strong and weak biofilm producer A. baumannii strains were detected within 10 h by RTCA method (P < 0.05). We also observed that sub-minimum inhibitory concentrations of NAC + TGC and ASA + TGC combinations could significantly reduce biofilm formation and expression of biofilm-related genes in A. baumanii strains. No statistically significant activity of the tested drugs was detected against mature biofilms of the bacterial strains with the RTCA method. These results suggest that reproducible results on biofilm production capacity of A. baumannii strains and antibiofilm activities of various compounds can be obtained in a short time using RTCA method. Therefore, RTCA method seems to be a beneficial technique for biofilm detection and can help in combating A. baumannii infections by giving health providers the opportunity of implementing antibiofilm treatment strategies in a timely manner.	2022 Jul	Aybala Temel, Bayrı Erac	Curr Microbiol

36830307	Emergence and Evolution of OXA-23-Producing ST46<sub>Pas</sub>-ST462<sub>Oxf</sub>-KL28-OCL1 Carbapenem-Resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> Mediated by a Novel IS<i>Aba1</i>-Based Tn<i>7534</i> Transposon.	Carbapenem-resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> (CRAB) isolates of global clone 1 (GC1) and global clone 2 (GC2) have been widely reported. Nevertheless, non-GC1 and non-GC2 CRAB strains have been studied less. In particular, no reports concerning sequence type 46 (ST46<sub>Pas</sub>) CRAB strains have been described thus far. In this work, the genomic features and possible evolution mechanism of ST46<sub>Pas</sub> OXA-23-producing CRAB isolates from clinical specimens are reported for the first time. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing of three ST46<sub>Pas</sub> strains revealed identical resistance profiles (resistance to imipenem, meropenem, ciprofloxacin and the combination of cefoperazone/sulbactam at a 2:1 ratio). They were found to belong to ST46<sub>Pas</sub> and ST462<sub>Oxf</sub> with capsular polysaccharide 28 (KL28) and lipooligosaccharide 1 (OCL1), respectively. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) revealed that all contained one copy of chromosomal <i>bla</i><sub>OXA-23</sub>, which was located in a novel IS<i>Aba1</i>-based Tn<i>7534</i> composite transposon. In particular, another copy of the Tn<i>7534</i> composite transposon was identified in an Hgz_103-type plasmid with 9 bp target site duplications (TSDs, ACAACATGC) in the <i>A. baumannii</i> ZHOU strain. As the strains originated from two neighboring intensive care units (ICUs), ST46<sub>Pas</sub> OXA-23-producing CRAB strains may have evolved via transposition events or a p<i>dif</i> module. Based on the GenBank database, ST46<sub>Pas</sub> strains were collected from various sources; however, most were collected in Hangzhou (China) from 2014 to 2021. Pan-genome analysis revealed 3276 core genes, 0 soft-core genes, 768 shell genes and 443 cloud genes shared among all ST46<sub>Pas</sub> strains. In conclusion, the emergence of ST46<sub>Pas</sub> CRAB strains might present a new threat to healthcare settings; therefore, effective surveillance is required to prevent further dissemination.	2023 Feb	Haiyang Liu, Xiaochen Liu, Jintao He, Linghong Zhang, Feng Zhao, Zhihui Zhou, Xiaoting Hua, Yunsong Yu	Antibiotics (Basel)

36677463	Carbapenem-Resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>: Biofilm-Associated Genes, Biofilm-Eradication Potential of Disinfectants, and Biofilm-Inhibitory Effects of Selenium Nanoparticles.	This study aimed to investigate the biofilm-production ability of carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB), the biofilm-eradication potential of 70% ethanol and 0.5% sodium hypochlorite, the effects of selenium nanoparticles (SeNPs) against planktonic and biofilm-embedded CRAB, and the relationship between biofilm production and bacterial genotypes. A total of 111 CRAB isolates were tested for antimicrobial susceptibility, biofilm formation, presence of the genes encoding carbapenemases, and biofilm-associated virulence factors. The antibiofilm effects of disinfectants and SeNPs against CRAB isolates were also tested. The vast majority of the tested isolates were biofilm producers (91.9%). The bap, ompA, and csuE genes were found in 57%, 70%, and 76% of the CRAB isolates, with the csuE being significantly more common among biofilm producers (78.6%) compared to non-biofilm-producing CRAB (25%). The tested disinfectants showed a better antibiofilm effect on moderate and strong biofilm producers than on weak producers (p < 0.01). The SeNPs showed an inhibitory effect against all tested planktonic (MIC range: 0.00015 to >1.25 mg/mL) and biofilm-embedded CRAB, with a minimum biofilm inhibitory concentration of less than 0.15 mg/mL for 90% of biofilm producers. In conclusion, SeNPs might be used as promising therapeutic and medical device coating agents, thus serving as an alternative approach for the prevention of biofilm-related infections.	2023 Jan	Aleksandra Smitran, Bojana Lukovic, LJiljana Bozic, Dijana Jelic, Milos Jovicevic, Jovana Kabic, Dusan Kekic, Jovana Ranin, Natasa Opavski, Ina Gajic	Microorganisms

36009955	<i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> Infection-Related Mortality in Hospitalized Patients: Risk Factors and Potential Targets for Clinical and Antimicrobial Stewardship Interventions.	Due to resistance and scarcity of treatment options, nosocomial Acinetobacter baumannii infections are associated with significant fatality rates. We investigated the factors contributing to infection-related deaths to develop tailored stewardship interventions that could reduce these high mortality rates. We reviewed the medical records of adult inpatients with A. baumannii infections over two years. Patient demographics and clinical data were collected and statistically analyzed. The study included 321 patients with positive A. baumannii microbiological cultures, with respiratory infections accounting for 58.6%, soft tissues 29.3%, bacteremia 8.6%, urine 2.1%, and others 1.4%. The study population’s median (IQR) age was 62.6 (38.9−94.9) years, and hospital stay was 20 (9.5−40) days. Statistical analysis revealed that various risk factors contribute significantly to high in-hospital all-cause mortality (44%), as well as 14-day and 28-day mortality rates. Deaths increased by a factor of 1.04 with every additional year of age (p = 0.000), admission to the critical care unit (p = 0.000, OR: 2.86), and patients admitted with an infectious diagnosis had nearly three times the mortality rate as those admitted with other diagnoses (p = 0.000, OR: 3.12). Male gender (p < 0.001, OR: 2.14), any comorbid conditions (p = 0.000, OR: 5.29), prolonged hospitalization (>7 days) (p = 0.023, OR: 1.98), and hospital acquisition of infection (p = 0.027, OR: 1.68) were among the most significant predictors of mortality. All variables were investigated for their impact on all-cause, 14-day, and 28-day mortality rates. Improving multidisciplinary infection control practices, regular disinfection of patient care equipment, and optimal intubation practice that avoids unnecessary intubation are necessary interventions to reduce infection-related mortality rates. Better antibiotic selection and de-escalation, shorter hospital stays whenever possible, prompt medical stabilization of comorbid conditions, and fewer unnecessary admissions to critical care units will all lead to improved outcomes.	2022 Aug	Diaa Alrahmany, Ahmed F Omar, Aisha Alreesi, Gehan Harb, Islam M Ghazi	Antibiotics (Basel)
35644906	Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy as a new tool for surveillance in local stewardship antimicrobial program: a retrospective study in a nosocomial Acinetobacter baumannii outbreak.	The aim of our study is to determine the discriminatory power of the Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), using multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) as molecular typing references. The study included seventeen isolates (OXA-23- and OXA-58-producing Acinetobacter baumannii) previously recovered from clinical specimens during the period May 2010-April 2011. Molecular typing was performed by PFGE and MLST. The specimens were analyzed in quadruplicate using the IR Biotyper (Bruker GmbH, Bremen, Germany). For each isolate, the average of the spectra was used for the analysis of the data. Comparing FTIR data with MLST, the results obtained by IR Biotyper are very consistent with those from MLST, since the software was able to differentiate the three ST assigned to the strains. Comparing FTIR data with PFGE, most results could be confirmed, as IR Biotyper clearly differentiated ST-80 SLV OXA-58-producing A. baumannii (pulsotype 3) from the rest of strains of OXA-58-producing A. baumannii (pulsotypes 1 and 2). All the OXA-23-producing A. baumannii isolates (pulsotype 4) grouped together by FTIR. FTIR proved to be an effective tool to investigate local epidemiology, and can achieve the same typeability and discriminatory power as genome-based methods.	2022 Sep	Inmaculada Guerrero-Lozano, Fátima Galán-Sánchez, Manuel Rodríguez-Iglesias	Braz J Microbiol
37104206	Therapeutic Prospection of Animal Venoms-Derived Antimicrobial Peptides against Infections by Multidrug-Resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>: A Systematic Review of Pre-Clinical Studies.	Infections caused by multidrug-resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> (MDR-Ab) have become a public health emergency. Due to the small therapeutic arsenal available to treat these infections, health agencies have highlighted the importance of developing new antimicrobials against MDR-Ab. In this context, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) stand out, and animal venoms are a rich source of these compounds. Here, we aimed to summarize the current knowledge on the use of animal venom-derived AMPs in the treatment of MDR-Ab infections in vivo. A systematic review was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. The eight studies included in this review identified the antibacterial activity of eleven different AMPs against MDR-Ab. Most of the studied AMPs originated from arthropod venoms. In addition, all AMPs are positively charged and rich in lysine residues. In vivo assays showed that the use of these compounds reduces MDR-Ab-induced lethality and bacterial load in invasive (bacteremia and pneumonia) and superficial (wounds) infection models. Moreover, animal venom-derived AMPs have pleiotropic effects, such as pro-healing, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant activities, that help treat infections. Animal venom-derived AMPs are a potential source of prototype molecules for the development of new therapeutic agents against MDR-Ab.	2023 Apr	William Gustavo Lima, Maria Elena de Lima	Toxins (Basel)

36526063	Pyrogallol downregulates the expression of virulence-associated proteins in Acinetobacter baumannii and showing anti-infection activity by improving non-specific immune response in zebrafish model.	Acinetobacter baumannii, a virulent uropathogen with widespread antibiotic resistance, has arisen as a critical scientific challenge, necessitating the development of innovative therapeutic agents. This is the first study reveal the proteomic changes in A. baumannii upon pyrogallol treatment for understanding the mechanisms using nano-LC-MS/MS-based quantitative proteomics and qPCR analysis. The obtained results found that pyrogallol treatment dramatically downregulated the expression level of several key proteins such as GroEL, DnaK, ClpB, SodB, KatE, Bap, CsuA/B, PgaA, PgaC, BfmR, OmpA, and SecA in A. baumannii, which are involved in chaperone-mediated oxidative stress responses, antioxidant defence system, biofilm formation, virulence enzyme production, bacterial adhesion, capsule formation, and antibiotic resistance. Accordingly, the pyrogallol dramatically enhanced the lifespan of A. baumannii-infected zebrafish by inhibiting bacterial colonization, demonstrating the anti-infective potential of pyrogallol against A. baumannii. Further, the histopathological results also demonstrated the disease protection efficacy of pyrogallol against the pathognomonic sign of A. baumannii infection. In addition, the pyrogallol treatment effectively improved the immune parameters such as serum myeloperoxidase activity, leukocyte respiratory burst activity, and serum lysozyme activity in zebrafish against A. baumannii infection. Based on the results, the present study strongly proposes pyrogallol as a promising therapeutic agent for treating A. baumannii infection.	2023 Jan	Gurusamy Abirami, Rajaiah Alexpandi, Sadasivan Sudhin, Ravindran Durgadevi, Prithiviraj Swasthikka Roshni, Ponnuchamy Kumar, Arumugam Veera Ravi	Int J Biol Macromol
36343485	Eugenol and geraniol impede Csu-pilus assembly and evades multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii biofilms: In-vitro and in-silico evidence.	Acinetobacter baumannii forms robust biofilms, which aid protection against antimicrobials and account for adaptation in hospital settings. Biofilm formation by A. baumannii has worsens the scenario of drug resistance. Therefore, new strategies are required to tackle biofilm-forming multidrug-resistant A. baumannii. The present study investigated compounds with antimicrobials and antibiofilm properties against A. baumannii. Different antimicrobials were selected from available reports. Initially, comparative antimicrobial activity against A. baumannii isolates was assessed. Most potent antimicrobial compounds were further analyzed for time-kill kinetics, biofilm inhibition, and exopolysaccharide (EPS) reduction in their presence and absence. The antibiofilm potentials were also confirmed with SEM analysis. The relative gene expression of the csuE gene and molecular docking was carried out to investigate the molecular mechanism of mature biofilm disruption. The results demonstrated eugenol and geraniol as the most potent inhibitors with MICs of 6.08 mM and 3.24 mM, respectively, with the potential to significantly inhibit growth and EPS production. Complete inhibition of A. baumannii mature biofilms was observed with a maximum of 60.89 mM and 129.6 mM concentrations of eugenol and geraniol, respectively. The SEM analysis and lower expression of the csuE gene showed the effectiveness of potent antibiofilm agents. In-silico docking showed efficient binding of eugenol and geraniol with the csuE protein of archaic pilus. The findings of molecular docking concordant the assumption that these molecules may prevent the assembly of mature pilus, which results in abolished biofilms. In conclusion, the antibiofilm virtues of eugenol and geraniol were elucidated to be used in the future to control the persistence of biofilm-forming drug-resistant A. baumannii.	2022 Dec	Monika Choudhary, Rahul Shrivastava, Jitendraa Vashistt	Biochem Biophys Res Commun

37072328	5,7-Diamino-3,5,7,9-tetradeoxynon-2-ulosonic Acids in the Capsular Polysaccharides of Acinetobacter baumannii.	The polysaccharide capsule surrounding bacterial cell plays an important role in pathogenesis of infections caused by the opportunistic pathogen Acinetobacter baumannii by providing protection from external factors. The structures of the capsular polysaccharide (CPS) produced by A. baumannii isolates and the corresponding CPS biosynthesis gene clusters are highly diverse, although many of them are related. Many types of A. baumannii CPSs contain isomers of 5,7-diamino-3,5,7,9-tetradeoxynon-2-ulosonic acid (DTNA). Three of these isomers, namely acinetaminic acid (l-glycero-l-altro isomer), 8-epiacinetaminic acid (d-glycero-l-altro isomer), and 8-epipseudaminic acid (d-glycero-l-manno isomer), have not been found so far in naturally occurring carbohydrates from other species. In A. baumannii CPSs, DTNAs carry N-acyl substituents at positions 5 and 7; in some CPSs, both N-acetyl and N-(3-hydroxybutanoyl) groups are present. Remarkably, pseudaminic acid carries the (R)-isomer and legionaminic acid carries the (S)-isomer of the 3-hydroxybutanoyl group. The review addresses the structure and genetics of biosynthesis of A. baumannii CPSs containing di-N-acyl derivatives of DTNA.	2023 Feb	Yuriy A Knirel, Anastasia A Kasimova, Nikolay P Arbatsky, Mikhail M Shneider, Anastasia V Popova, Fedor A Brovko, Aleksander S Shashkov, Sofia N Senchenkova, Andrei V Perepelov, Anna M Shpirt	Biochemistry (Mosc)
36986580	Drug Combination of Ciprofloxacin and Polymyxin B for the Treatment of Multidrug-Resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> Infections: A Drug Pair Limiting the Development of Resistance.	Polymyxins are considered as last-resort antibiotics to treat infections caused by <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>. However, there are increasing reports of resistance in <i>A. baumannii</i> to polymyxins. In this study, inhalable combinational dry powders consisting of ciprofloxacin (CIP) and polymyxin B (PMB) were prepared by spray-drying. The obtained powders were characterized with respect to the particle properties, solid state, in vitro dissolution and in vitro aerosol performance. The antibacterial effect of the combination dry powders against multidrug-resistant <i>A. baumannii</i> was assessed in a time-kill study. Mutants from the time-kill study were further investigated by population analysis profiling, minimum inhibitory concentration testing, and genomic comparisons. Inhalable dry powders consisting of CIP, PMB and their combination showed a fine particle fraction above 30%, an index of robust aerosol performance of inhaled dry powder formulations in the literature. The combination of CIP and PMB exhibited a synergistic antibacterial effect against <i>A. baumannii</i> and suppressed the development of CIP and PMB resistance. Genome analyses revealed only a few genetic differences of 3-6 SNPs between mutants and the progenitor isolate. This study suggests that inhalable spray-dried powders composed of the combination of CIP and PMB is promising for the treatment of respiratory infections caused by <i>A. baumannii</i>, and this combination can enhance the killing efficiency and suppress the development of drug resistance.	2023 Feb	Junwei Wang, Marc Stegger, Arshnee Moodley, Mingshi Yang	Pharmaceutics
36860160	Incidence, mortality, and risk factors associated with carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii bacteremia within 30 days after liver transplantation.	Carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii bacteremia (CRAB-B) is a fatal infectious complication of liver transplantation (LT). This study investigated the incidence, effects, and risk factors associated with CRAB-B during the early post-LT period. Among 1051 eligible LT recipients, 29 patients experienced CRAB-B within 30 days of LT with a cumulative incidence of 2.7%. In the patients with CRAB-B (n = 29) and matched controls (n = 145) by nested-case control design, the cumulative incidence of death on days 5, 10, and 30 from the index date was 58.6%, 65.5%, and 65.5%, and 2.1%, 2.8%, and 4.2%, respectively (p < .001). Pre-transplant MELD (OR 1.11, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04-1.19, p = .002), severe encephalopathy (OR 4.62, 95% CI 1.24-18.61, p = .025), donor body mass index (OR .57, 95% CI .41-.75, p < .001), and reoperation (OR 6.40, 95% CI 1.19-36.82, p = .032) were independent risk factors for 30-day CRAB-B. CRAB-B showed extremely high mortality within 30 days after LT, especially within 5 days after its occurrence. Therefore, assessment of risk factors and early detection of CRAB, followed by proper treatment, are necessary to control CRAB-B after LT.	2023 May	Eun-Ki Min, Seung Hyuk Yim, Mun Chae Choi, Jae Geun Lee, Dong Jin Joo, Myoung Soo Kim, Deok-Gie Kim	Clin Transplant
36651366	Anti-inflammatory effects of NaB and NaPc in <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>-stimulated THP-1 cells <i>via</i> TLR-2/NF-κB/ROS/NLRP3 pathway.	This study evaluated the anti-inflammation effect of the three main short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) on <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>-induced THP-1 cells. The three main SCFAs could inhibit <i>A. baumannii</i>-stimulated THP-1 cell NF-κB pathway activity and the expressions of NLRP3 inflamma-some and GSDMD, and increase autophagy. The three main SCFAs, especially the sodium butyrate (NaB), had the effect of down-regulation of ROS and <i>TLR-2</i> expression in THP-1 cells. NaB and sodium propionate (NaPc), but not sodium acetate (NaAc), dramatically suppressed <i>IL-1β</i> and <i>IFN-γ</i> expression. The results indicated that NaB and NaPc could significantly inhibit the inflammation of THP-1 cells induced by <i>A. baumannii</i>, and the inhibitory effect was in the order of NaB > NaPc > NaAC. NaB and NaPc may inhibit inflammation through TLR-2/NF-κB/ROS/NLRP3 signaling pathway.	2022 Dec	Chen Shu, Zhang Yan-Yan, Zhang Hai, Ding Long-Kun, Xi Yue, Yan Man, Sun Chang, Wu Liang, Hu Hao	Acta Pharm
36240659	In silico and in vitro insights into the prediction and analysis of natural photosensitive compounds targeting Acinetobacter baumannii biofilm-associated protein.	The spread of Acinetobacter baumannii strains has become a global concern due to its extensive antibiotic resistance and biofilm formation. To overcome it, new antimicrobial strategies have been needed. Among them, antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) is an efficient approach against various microorganisms. This study was focused on the use of curcumin (Cur) and quercetin (Qct) as natural photosensitive compounds to improve the activity of aPDT against A. baumannii biofilm-associated protein (Bap).	2022 Dec	Maryam Pourhajibagher, Farzaneh Bazarjani, Abbas Bahador	Photodiagnosis Photodyn Ther
36014428	<i>In Silico</i> Evaluation of Bioactive Compounds of <i>Artemisia pallens</i> Targeting the Efflux Protein of Multidrug-Resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> (LAC-4 Strain).	<i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> (<i>A. baumannii</i>) is one of the major representative aetiologies of recalcitrant nosocomial infections. Genotypic and phenotypic alterations in <i>A. baumannii</i> have resulted in a significant surge in multidrug resistance (MDR). Of all the factors responsible for the development of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), efflux protein pumps play a paramount role. In pursuit of a safe alternative for the prevention and control of <i>A. baumannii</i> infections, bioactive compounds from the aerial parts of the medicinal plant <i>Artemisia pallens</i> were studied. GC-MS analysis of the ethanol extract of <i>A. pallens</i> detected five major compounds: lilac alcohol A, spathulenol, lilac alcohol C, n-hexadecanoic acid, and vulgarin. In silico examinations were performed using the Schrödinger suite. Homology modelling was performed to predict the structure of the efflux protein of <i>A. baumannii</i>-LAC-4 strain (MDR Ab-EP). The identified bioactive compounds were analysed for their binding efficiency with MDR Ab-EP. High binding efficiency was observed with vulgarin with a glide score of -4.775 kcal/mol and stereoisomers of lilac alcohol A (-3.706 kcal/mol) and lilac alcohol C (-3.706 kcal/mol). Our molecular dynamic simulation studies unveiled the stability of the ligand-efflux protein complex. Vulgarin and lilac alcohol A possessed strong and stable binding efficiency with MDR Ab-EP. Furthermore, validation of the absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET) properties of the ligands strongly suggested that these compounds could serve as a lead molecule in the development of an alternate drug from <i>A. pallens</i>.	2022 Aug	Suvaiyarasan Suvaithenamudhan, Sivapunniyam Ananth, Vanitha Mariappan, Victor Violet Dhayabaran, Subbiah Parthasarathy, Pitchaipillai Sankar Ganesh, Esaki Muthu Shankar	Molecules
35884165	The Impact of Antimicrobial Stewardship and Infection Control Interventions on <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> Resistance Rates in the ICU of a Tertiary Care Center in Lebanon.	Antimicrobial resistance is a serious threat to global health, causing increased mortality and morbidity especially among critically ill patients. This toll is expected to rise following the COVID-19 pandemic. Carbapenem-resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> (CRAb) is among the Gram-negative pathogens leading antimicrobial resistance globally; it is listed as a critical priority pathogen by the WHO and is implicated in hospital-acquired infections and outbreaks, particularly in critically ill patients. Recent reports from Lebanon describe increasing rates of infection with CRAb, hence the need to develop concerted interventions to control its spread. We set to describe the impact of combining antimicrobial stewardship and infection control measures on resistance rates and colonization pressure of CRAb in the intensive care units of a tertiary care center in Lebanon before the COVID-19 pandemic. The antimicrobial stewardship program introduced a carbapenem-sparing initiative in April 2019. During the same period, infection control interventions involved focused screening, monitoring, and tracking of CRAb, as well as compliance with specific measures. From January 2018 to January 2020, we report a statistically significant decrease in carbapenem consumption and a decrease in resistance rates of isolated <i>A. baumannii</i>. The colonization pressure of CRAb also decreased significantly, reaching record low levels at the end of the intervention period. The results indicate that a multidisciplinary approach and combined interventions between the stewardship and infection control teams can lead to a sustained reduction in resistance rates and CRAb spread in ICUs.	2022 Jul	Nesrine A Rizk, Nada Zahreddine, Nisrine Haddad, Rihab Ahmadieh, Audra Hannun, Souad Bou Harb, Sara F Haddad, Rony M Zeenny, Souha S Kanj	Antibiotics (Basel)
36717837	Glycyrrhetinic acid protects against Multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii-induced lung epithelial cells injury by regulating inflammation and oxidative stress.	Glycyrrhetinic acid (GA) is a bio-effective component of Licorice. The GA is a monomer and the ingredient is an Oleanane-type pentacyclic triterpenes that has been used as a remedy for years. Due to the abuse of antibiotics, people pay attention to the emergence of Multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (MDR-AB). As a conditional pathogen, MDR-AB causes severe infection, endangering human lives. Our previous studies found GA played an important role in Yinhua Pinggan, a Chinese medicine. However, whether GA could protect lung epithelium from MDR-AB-induced cell injury was elusive. Herein, we investigated the effects of GA on MDR-AB-infected A549 cells. The results showed GA had slightly antibacterial activity to MDR-AB in the GA (high concentration) but no impact on drug resistance genes. Notwithstanding, GA could reverse MDR-AB-induced cell apoptosis, hampered adhesion and invasion of MDR-AB to cells, and inhibit pro-inflammatory cytokines expression of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF. Besides, MDR-AB-induced reactive oxygen species, pro-oxidative protein malonaldehyde, and myeloperoxidase of cells were decreased by GA, while antioxidative proteins were recovered, showing antioxidative capacity of GA might play a critical role. The expressions of toll-like receptor (TLRs) - 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 9 were increased by MDR-AB infection, while GA reversed the tendency. Interestingly, GA inhibited MDR-AB induced myeloiddifferentiationfactor88 expression (MYD88), one downstream con-factors of TLRs, but no affection on Interferon regulatory Factor 3 (IRF3), the other one, indicating GA inhibited MDR-AB induced cell injury by impact TLR/MYD88 pathway to attenuate inflammation. Altogether, our results demonstrated that GA protects against MDR-AB-induced cell injury through its antioxidative and anti-inflammatory properties, which deserve further study in the future.	2023 Jan	Piaoyi Guo, Liang Jin, Huifen Zhou, Yida Bao, Jiehong Yang, Jing Chen, Yu He, Daojun Yu, Haitong Wan	BMC Pharmacol Toxicol

35683622	Colistin Monotherapy versus Colistin plus Meropenem Combination Therapy for the Treatment of Multidrug-Resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> Infection: A Meta-Analysis.	(1) Introduction: Colistin combination therapy with other antibiotics is a way to enhance colistin activity. The purpose of this meta-analysis was to compare the efficacy and safety of treatment with colistin monotherapy versus colistin plus meropenem combination therapy in patients with drug-resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> infection. (2) Methods: All studies were included if they reported one or more of the following outcomes: clinical improvement, complete microbiological response, 14-day mortality, hospital mortality, or nephrotoxicity. (3) Results: Three randomized controlled trials and seven retrospective studies were included in the meta-analysis. Colistin monotherapy has similar rates of clinical improvement, 14-day mortality, hospital mortality, and nephrotoxicity as colistin plus meropenem combination therapy. Regarding complete microbiological response, the colistin plus meropenem combination was better than colistin monotherapy. (4) Discussion: Previous meta-analyses demonstrated heterogeneity in study quality and a lack of evidence supporting the use of colistin-based combination therapy. Our meta-analysis clearly showed that colistin combined with meropenem was not superior to colistin monotherapy for the treatment of <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> infection. (5) Conclusions: The efficacy and safety of treatment with colistin monotherapy and that of colistin plus meropenem combination therapy in patients with drug-resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> infection were comparable. The majority of the evidence was obtained from nonrandomized studies, and high-quality randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm the role of colistin plus meropenem combination therapy in the treatment of multidrug-resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> infection.	2022 Jun	Chienhsiu Huang, Ihung Chen, Tiju Tang	J Clin Med

37217796	In vitro activity of ceftazidime/avibactam, imipenem/relebactam and meropenem/vaborbactam alone or in combination with polymyxin B against carbapenem resistant Acinetobacter baumannii.	Nosocomial infection caused by Carbapenem-Resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CR-A. baumannii) has become a challenge in clinical practice. Acting as the last resort antibacterial agents for the treatment of CR-A. baumannii infection, polymyxins have high risk of nephrotoxicity and poor clinical efficacy. Ceftazidime/avibactam, imipenem/relebactam and meropenem/vaborbactam are three β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combination complexes that newly approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacterial infection. In this study, we analyzed the in vitro activity of those novel antibacterial agents alone or in combination with polymyxin B against the CR-A. baumannii obtained from a Chinese tertiary hospital. Our results suggest that those novel antibacterial agents should not be used alone for the treatment of CR-A. baumannii infection, as they cannot prevent the regrowth of bacteria at the clinical achievable blood concentration. Imipenem/relebactam and meropenem/vaborbactam should not be used as the substitutes of imipenem and meropenem for polymyxin B based combination therapy against CR-A. baumannii, since they have no edge over imipenem and meropenem on antibacterial activity when in combination with polymyxin B. Ceftazidime/avibactam may be more suitable than ceftazidime for polymyxin B based combination therapy against CR-A. baumannii, as it has a higher synergistic rate with polymyxin B, and the antibacterial activity of ceftazidime/avibactam is much higher than that of ceftazidime when tested in combination with polymyxin B. Ceftazidime/avibactam may also be the better choice than imipenem and meropenem for polymyxin B based combination therapy against CR-A. baumannii, as it has a higher synergistic rate with polymyxin B.	2023 May	Rongxin Liang, Dongxing Wang, Mingjin Hu, Yuxia Gu, Meijun Wang, Dan Hu, Mingan Zhu, Meng Wang	J Antibiot (Tokyo)
36762540	Molecular tracking of carbapenem-resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> clinical isolates: a multicentre study over a 4-year period across eastern China.	<b>Introduction</b>. Colonization by carbapenem-resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> (CRAB) causes therapeutic and economic problems for critically ill patients.<b>Gap Statement</b>. The analysis of CRAB in China was limited to certain regions.<b>Aims</b>. To investigate the antibiotic susceptibility, molecular characterization and clonal relationship among CRAB isolates from multiple hospitals of eastern China.<b>Methodology</b>. Isolates from 29 tertiary hospitals from September 2015 to September 2018 were recovered. All strains were analysed using antimicrobial susceptibility testing to detect their tolerance. PCR was also used to detect multiple β-lactamase genes. After multilocus sequence typing (MLST) of seven house-keeping genes. eBURST was used to assess clonal complexes and explore evolutionary relationships.<b>Results</b>. All isolates showed resistance to carbapenems, while remaining susceptible to colistin and tigecycline. All isolates were detected with <i>bla</i> <sub>OXA-51</sub> gene by PCR, and 80.1 % harboured the <i>bla</i> <sub>OXA-23</sub> gene. The prevalence of bla<sub>OXA-23</sub> gene was remarkably increased from 50.7 % in 2015 to 90.5 % in 2018. Other genes such as <i>bla</i> <sub>OXA-24</sub>, <i>bla</i> <sub>OXA-58</sub>, <i>bla</i> <sub>IMP-2/4</sub>, <i>bla</i> <sub>VIM-2</sub>, <i>bla</i> <sub>SHV</sub>, <i>bla</i> <sub>AmpC</sub> and <i>bla</i> <sub>TEM</sub> were also obtained. While <i>bla</i> <sub>KPC</sub>, <i>bla</i> <sub>NDM-1</sub>, <i>bla</i> <sub>IMP-4</sub> and <i>bla</i> <sub>SIM-1</sub> were not found in these strains. MLST showed all isolates could be divided into 26 known sequence types (STs) and ten novel STs and 47.2 % isolates belong to ST195 and ST208. eBURST revealed clonal complex 92 as the major clonal complex (98.4 %), which includes 88.5 % (23/26) of known STs and 80 % (8/10) of unknown STs. Phylogenetic analysis also found that almost all CRAB isolates could cluster into one lineage, suggesting an epidemic of this CRAB lineage. This indicated severe nosocomial infections of CRAB in multiple hospitals of eastern China.<b>Conclusion</b>. An outbreak of ST195 and ST208 CRAB-resistant clones with <i>bla</i> <sub>OXA-23</sub> gene might be happening in multiple hospitals in eastern China.	2023 Feb	Yayun Zhao, Yunzhu Zhu, Hui Zhang, Lingyan Zhang, Jiabin Li, Ying Ye	J Med Microbiol
36314248	Ag NCs as a potent antibiofilm agent against pathogenic <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> and <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> and drug-resistant <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> by affecting chemotaxis and flagellar assembly pathway genes.	Biofilm infections are highly resistant to commercial antibiotics. Therefore, developing a potent agent against such drug-resistant bacterial infections is highly desirable. Here, we synthesized positively charged silver nanoclusters (Ag NCs) with a diameter of <2 nm, which were found to be very effective antibacterial and antibiofilm agents against tetracycline-resistant <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> and most importantly multidrug-resistant pathogenic strains of <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> and <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>. Ag NCs were able to both prevent and eradicate the biofilm formation very effectively. The antibiofilm activity can be significantly increased with α-amylase and/or DNase which degrade the structural components of biofilms. The antibiofilm activity of antibiotics gets considerably lowered due to poor penetration and the acidic microenvironment of biofilms. However, the potency of antibiotics gets significantly increased when applied with Ag NCs. Finally, RNA seq-based analysis has demonstrated that the biofilm degradation was likely due to the regulation of bacterial chemotaxis and flagellar assembly pathway genes by Ag NCs.	2022 Nov	Anirudh Singh, Komal Rani, Vibha Tandon, Amaresh Kumar Sahoo, Sintu Kumar Samanta	Biomater Sci
35156902	High throughput virtual screening and molecular dynamics simulation analysis of phytomolecules against BfmR of <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>: anti-virulent drug development campaign.	<i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> is a notorious multidrug resistant bacterium responsible for several hospital acquired infections assisted by its capacity to develop biofilms. <i>A. baumannii</i> BfmR (RstA), a response regulator from the BfmR/S two-component signal transduction system, is the major controller of <i>A. baumannii</i> biofilm development and formation. As a result, BfmR represents a novel target for anti-biofilm treatment against <i>A. baumannii</i>. The discovery of the high-resolution crystal structure of BfmR provides a good chance for computational screening of its probable inhibitors. Therefore, in this study we aim to search new, less toxic, and natural BfmR inhibitors from 8450 phytomolecules available in the Indian Medicinal Plants, Phytochemistry and Therapeutic (IMPPAT) database by analyzing molecular docking against BfmR (PDB ID: 6BR7). Out of these 8450 phytomolecules 6742 molecules were successfully docked with BfmR with the docking score range -6.305 kcal/mol to +5.120 kcal/mol. Structure based-molecular docking (SB-MD) and ADMET (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, & toxicity) profile examination revealed that Norepinephrine, Australine, Calystegine B3, 7,7 A-Diepialexine, and Alpha-Methylnoradrenaline phytocompounds strongly binds to the active site residues of BfmR. Furthermore, molecular dynamics simulation (MDS) studies for 100 ns and the binding free energy (MM/GBSA) analysis elucidated the binding mechanism of Calystegine B3, 7,7 A-Diepialexine, and Alpha-Methylnoradrenaline to BfmR. In summary, these phytocompounds seems to have the promising molecules against BfmR, and thus necessitates further verification by both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> experiments. HighlightsBfmR plays a key role in biofilm development and exopolysaccharide (EPS) synthesis in <i>A. baumannii.</i>Computational approach to search for promising BfmR inhibitors from IMPAAT database.The lead phytomolecules such as Calystegine B3, 7,7 A-Diepialexine, and Alpha-Methylnoradrenaline displayed significant binding with BfmR active site.The outcome of BfmR binding phytomolecules has broadened the scope of hit molecules validation.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

36293559	Effects of Sub-Minimum Inhibitory Concentrations of Imipenem and Colistin on Expression of Biofilm-Specific Antibiotic Resistance and Virulence Genes in <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> Sequence Type 1894.	Antibiotics at suboptimal doses promote biofilm formation and the development of antibiotic resistance. The underlying molecular mechanisms, however, were not investigated. Here, we report the effects of sub-minimum inhibitory concentrations (sub-MICs) of imipenem and colistin on genes associated with biofilm formation and biofilm-specific antibiotic resistance in a multidrug-tolerant clinical strain of <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> Sequence Type (ST) 1894. Comparative transcriptome analysis was performed in untreated biofilm and biofilm treated with sub-MIC doses of imipenem and colistin. RNA sequencing data showed that 78 and 285 genes were differentially expressed in imipenem and colistin-treated biofilm cells, respectively. Among the differentially expressed genes (DEGs), 48 and 197 genes were upregulated exclusively in imipenem and colistin-treated biofilm cells, respectively. The upregulated genes included those encoding matrix synthesis (<i>pgaB</i>), multidrug efflux pump (novel00738), fimbrial proteins, and homoserine lactone synthase (AbaI). Upregulation of biofilm-associated genes might enhance biofilm formation when treated with sub-MICs of antibiotics. The downregulated genes include those encoding DNA gyrase (novel00171), 30S ribosomal protein S20 (novel00584), and ribosome releasing factor (RRF) were downregulated when the biofilm cells were treated with imipenem and colistin. Downregulation of these genes affects protein synthesis, which in turn slows down cell metabolism and makes biofilm cells more tolerant to antibiotics. In this investigation, we also found that 5 of 138 small RNAs (sRNAs) were differentially expressed in biofilm regardless of antibiotic treatment or not. Of these, sRNA00203 showed the highest expression levels in biofilm. sRNAs regulate gene expression and are associated with biofilm formation, which may in turn affect the expression of biofilm-specific antibiotic resistance. In summary, when biofilm cells were exposed to sub-MIC doses of colistin and imipenem, coordinated gene responses result in increased biofilm production, multidrug efflux pump expression, and the slowdown of metabolism, which leads to drug tolerance in biofilm. Targeting antibiotic-induced or repressed biofilm-specific genes represents a new strategy for the development of innovative and effective treatments for biofilm-associated infections caused by <i>A. baumannii</i>.	2022 Oct	Abebe Mekuria Shenkutie, Jiaying Zhang, Mianzhi Yao, Daniel Asrat, Franklin W N Chow, Polly H M Leung	Int J Mol Sci
37120729	Meropenem in combination with baicalein exhibits synergism against extensively drug resistant and pan-drug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii clinical isolates in vitro.	Several studies have demonstrated that the effectiveness of carbapenems against drug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii infections has been decreasing. Combination therapy with two or more drugs is currently under investigation to overcome the emerging resistance against carbapenems. In this study, we tested the possible synergistic interactions of a potent antibacterial flavonoid, baicalein, with meropenem to illustrate this duo's antibacterial and antibiofilm effects on 15 extensively drug resistant or pan-drug-resistant (XDR/PDR) A. baumannii clinical isolates in vitro. Isolates included in the study were identified with MALDI-TOF MS, and antibiotic resistance patterns were studied according to EUCAST protocols. Carbapenem resistance was confirmed with the modified Hodge test, and resistance genes were also analyzed with genotypical methods. Then, checkerboard and time-kill assays were performed to analyze antibacterial synergism. Additionally, a biofilm inhibition assay was performed for screening the antibiofilm activity. To provide structural and mechanistic insights into baicalein action, protein-ligand docking, and interaction profiling calculations were conducted. Our study shed light on the remarkable potential of the baicalein-meropenem combination, since either synergistic or additive antibacterial activity was observed against every XDR/PDR A. baumannii strain in question. Furthermore, the baicalein-meropenem combination displayed significantly better antibiofilm activity in contrast to standalone use. In silico studies predicted that these positive effects arose from inhibition by baicalein of A. baumannii beta-lactamases and/or penicillin-binding proteins. Overall, our findings highlight the prospective potential benefits of baicalein in combination with meropenem for the treatment of carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii infections.	2023 Jan	Mümtaz Güran, Kadir Çakıral, Kerem Teralı, Tülay Kandemir, Gizem Şanlıtürk, Melda Meral Öcal, Toğrul Nagiyev, Fatih Köksal	Pathog Dis

36504816	Formic acid, an organic acid food preservative, induces viable-but-non-culturable state, and triggers new Antimicrobial Resistance traits in <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> and <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i>.	Numerous human pathogens, especially Gram-negative bacteria, are able to enter the viable-but-non-culturable (VBNC) state when they are exposed to environmental stressors and pose the risk of being resuscitated and causing infection after the removal of the trigger. Widely used food preservatives like weak organic acids are potential VBNC inducers in food processing and packaging facilities but have only been reported for food-borne pathogens. In the present study, it is demonstrated for the first time that one such agent, formic acid (FA), can induce a VBNC state at food processing, storage, and distribution temperatures (4, 25, and 37<sup>°</sup>C) with a varied time of treatment (days 4-10) in pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> and <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i>. The use of hospital-associated pathogens is critical based on the earlier reports that demonstrated the presence of these bacteria in hospital kitchens and commonly consumed foods. VBNC induction was validated by multiple parameters, e.g., non-culturability, metabolic activity as energy production, respiratory markers, and membrane integrity. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the removal of FA was able to resuscitate VBNC with an increased expression of multiple virulence and Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) genes in both <i>pathogens</i>. Since food additives/preservatives are significantly used in most food manufacturing facilities supplying to hospitals, contamination of these packaged foods with pathogenic bacteria and the consequence of exposure to food additives emerge as pertinent issues for infection control, and control of antimicrobial resistance in the hospital setting.	2022	Manisha Yadav, Samridhi Dhyani, Pooja Joshi, Sakshi Awasthi, Subhash Tanwar, Vishal Gupta, Deepak K Rathore, Susmita Chaudhuri	Front Microbiol
36500701	The Anti-Multidrug-Resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> Study on 1,3-diamino-7H-pyrrolo[3,2-f]quinazoline Compounds.	As a major public health problem, the prevalence of <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> (<i>A. baumannii</i>) infections in hospitals due to the pathogen's multiple-antibiotic resistance has attracted extensive attention. We previously reported a series of 1,3-diamino-7H-pyrrolo[3,2-f]quinazoline (PQZ) compounds, which were designed by targeting <i>Escherichia coli</i> dihydrofolate reductase (<i>ec</i>DHFR), and exhibited potent antibacterial activities. In the current study, based on our molecular-modeling study, it was proposed that PQZ compounds may function as potent <i>A. baumannii</i> DHFR (<i>ab</i>DHFR)-inhibitors as well, which inspired us to consider their anti-<i>A. baumannii</i> abilities. We further found that three PQZ compounds, OYYF-171, -172, and -175, showed significant antibacterial activities against <i>A. baumannii</i>, including multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains, which are significantly stronger than the typical DHFR-inhibitor, trimethoprim (TMP), and superior to, or comparable to, the other tested antibacterial agents belonging to β-lactam, aminoglycoside, and quinolone. The significant synergistic effect between the representative compound OYYF-171 and the dihydropteroate synthase (DHPS)-inhibitor sulfamethoxazole (SMZ) was observed in both the microdilution-checkerboard assay and time-killing assay, which indicated that using SMZ in combination with PQZ compounds could help to reduce the required dosage and forestall resistance. Our study shows that PQZ is a promising scaffold for the further development of folate-metabolism inhibitors against MDR <i>A. baumannii</i>.	2022 Dec	Han Wu, Hongtong Chen, Jungan Zhang, Xinxin Hu, Chunyang Xie, Weiting Cao, Ziqi Zhao, Zengshuo Xiao, Yixin Ren, Luyao Dong, Peiyi Sun, Xuefu You, Xinyi Yang, Wei Hong, Hao Wang	Molecules

Using data from a prospective, multiple-center, open-label clinical trial in 54 patients with hospital-acquired pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia caused by multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (Ab), we showed that a combined PK/PD index %(T > MICcpz*T > MICsul) is a more appropriate PK/PD index against Ab, compared to the PK/PD index (%T > MIC) for a single drug. For a 2 h infusion, the PK/PD cutoff of CPZ/SUL (2 g/1 g, q8h) for clinical and microbiological efficacy was 4/2 and 1/0.5 mg/L, respectively. The corresponding cumulative fraction of response was 46.5% and 25.3%, respectively. Results based on the combined PK/PD index were quite similar to that based on the joint probability of target attainment. The two drugs have interaction from the viewpoint of PK/PD. When the dose of one drug was too high, the PK/PD cutoff was often determined by another drug in which the dose was maintained. In most cases, sulbactam exerted the main effect against infection by Ab in the complex CPZ/SUL, which was similar to the literature reports. When the MIC of CPZ was 8, 16, or 32 mg/L, a CPZ/SUL 2 g/1 g (q8h), 2 g/2 g (q8h), or 2 g/2 g (q6h) (infusion was all 3 h) was recommended, respectively. A clinical efficacy and safety study to confirm simulation results is warranted.	2022 May	Yingjie Zhou, Jing Zhang, Yuancheng Chen, Jufang Wu, Beining Guo, Xiaojie Wu, Yingyuan Zhang, Minggui Wang, Ru Ya, Hao Huang	Antibiotics (Basel)
36980344	The Prevalence of Virulence Factor Genes among Carbapenem-Non-Susceptible <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> Clinical Strains and Their Usefulness as Potential Molecular Biomarkers of Infection.	Healthcare-associated infections caused by multidrug-resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> strains are a serious global threat. Therefore, it is important to expand the knowledge on the mechanisms of pathogenicity of these particular bacteria. The aim of this study was to assess the distribution of selected virulence factor genes (<i>bap</i>, <i>surA1</i>, <i>omp33-36</i>, <i>bauA</i>, <i>bauS</i>, and <i>pld</i>) among carbapenem-non-susceptible clinical <i>A. baumannii</i> isolates and to evaluate their potential usefulness as genetic markers for rapid diagnostics of <i>A. baumannii</i> infections. Moreover, we aimed to compare the virulence genes prevalence with the occurrence of carbapenemases genes. A total of 100 carbapenem-non-susceptible <i>A. baumannii</i> clinical isolates were included in the study. The presence of virulence factors and <i>bla</i><sub>OXA</sub> genes was evaluated by real-time PCR. The occurrence of virulence factors genes was as follows: 100.0% for the <i>bap</i> and <i>surA1</i> genes, 99.0% for the <i>basD</i> and <i>pld</i> genes. The <i>bauA</i> and <i>omp33-36</i> genes were absent among the studied strains. The predominant genes (<i>bap</i> and <i>surA1</i>) are involved in biofilm formation and their presence among all clinical strains can be applied as a genetic marker to recognize <i>A. baumannii</i> infection. High frequencies of the <i>basD</i> gene-involved in siderophore biosynthesis and the gene encoding phospholipase D (<i>pld</i>)-were also noted among <i>bla</i><sub>OXA</sub>-positive strains, showing their potential role in a pathogenicity of <i>bla</i><sub>OXA</sub>-positive <i>A. baumannii</i> clinical strains.	2023 Mar	Dagmara Depka, Tomasz Bogiel, Mateusz Rzepka, Eugenia Gospodarek-Komkowska	Diagnostics (Basel)
36154439	Genomic Analysis of Carbapenem-Resistant Acinetobacter baumannii Strains Recovered from Chilean Hospitals Reveals Lineages Specific to South America and Multiple Routes for Acquisition of Antibiotic Resistance Genes.	Carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CR<i>Ab</i>) is a public health threat accounting for a significant number of hospital-acquired infections. Despite the importance of this pathogen, there is scarce literature on A. baumannii molecular epidemiology and evolutionary pathways relevant to resistance emergence in South American strains. We analyzed the genomic context of 34 CR<i>Ab</i> isolates recovered from clinical samples between 2010 and 2013 from two hospitals in Santiago, Chile, using whole-genome sequencing. Several Institut Pasteur scheme sequence types (STs) were identified among the 34 genomes studied here, including ST1, ST15, ST79, ST162, and ST109. No ST2 (the most widespread sequence type) strain was detected. Chilean isolates were phylogenetically closely related, forming lineages specific to South America (e.g., ST1, ST79, and ST15). The genomic contexts of the resistance genes were diverse: while genes were present in a plasmid in ST15 strains, all genes were chromosomal in ST79 strains. Different variants of a small Rep_3 plasmid played a central role in the acquisition of the <i>oxa58</i> carbapenem and <i>aacC2</i> aminoglycoside resistance genes in ST1, ST15, and ST79 strains. The <i>aacC2</i> gene along with <i>bla</i><sub>TEM</sub> were found in a novel transposon named Tn<i>6925</i> here. Variants of Tn<i>7</i> were also found to play an important role in the acquisition of the <i>aadA1</i> and <i>dfrA1</i> genes. This work draws a detailed picture of the genetic context of antibiotic resistance genes in a set of carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii strains recovered from two Chilean hospitals and reveals a complex evolutionary picture of antibiotic resistance gene acquisition events via multiple routes involving several mobile genetic elements. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Treating infections caused by carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii (CR<i>Ab</i>) has become a global challenge given that CR<i>Ab</i> strains are also often resistant to a wide range of antibiotics. Analysis of whole-genome sequence data is now a standard approach for studying the genomic context of antibiotic resistance genes; however, genome sequence data from South American countries are scarce. Here, phylogenetic and genomic analyses of 34 CR<i>Ab</i> strains recovered from 2010 to 2013 from two Chilean hospitals revealed a complex picture leading to the generation of resistant lineages specific to South America. From these isolates, we characterized several mobile genetic elements, some of which are described for the first time. The genome sequences and analyses presented here further our understanding of the mechanisms leading to multiple-drug resistance, extensive drug resistance, and pandrug resistance phenotypes in South America. Therefore, this is a significant contribution to elucidating the global molecular epidemiology of CR<i>Ab</i>.	2022 Oct	Barbara P Brito, Jonathan Koong, Aniela Wozniak, Andres Opazo-Capurro, Joyce To, Patricia Garcia, Mehrad Hamidian	Microbiol Spectr

37043383	Development of an immunochromatographic lateral flow assay to rapidly detect OXA-23-, OXA-40-, OXA-58- and NDM-mediated carbapenem resistance determinants in <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>.	<b>Introduction.</b> <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> infections can be extremely challenging to treat owing to the worldwide prevalence of multidrug-resistant isolates, especially against carbapenems. Colonization with carbapenem-resistant <i>A. baumannii</i> (CRAb) requires rapid action from an infection control perspective because the organism is known for its propensity for epidemic spread<b>.</b> <b>Hypothesis/Gap Statement.</b> There is an unmet medical need to rapidly identify CRAb to enable appropriate antimicrobial treatment and to prevent transmission<b>.</b> <b>Aim.</b> Our aim was to expand the OXA-detection abilities of the rapid immunochromatographic test (ICT) OXA-23 <i>K</i>-SeT (Coris BioConcept) to include OXA-40- and OXA-58-like carbapenemases, which together confer carbapenem resistance to more than 94 % of CRAb isolates worldwide<b>.</b> <b>Methodology.</b> We used hybridoma technology to generate mAbs against OXA-40 and OXA-58 and selected them for productivity and specificity against recombinant and endogenous OXA-40 and OXA-58. Combinations of the resulting mAbs were analysed in ICT format for their ability to detect recombinant rOXA-40<sub>His6</sub> or rOXA-58<sub>His6</sub>, respectively. Subsequently, selected antibody pairs were implemented into single-OXA-40 or single-OXA-58 prototypes and the final OXA-23/40/58/NDM ICT and were evaluated on clinical <i>Acinetobacter</i> spp. isolates with well-defined carbapenem resistance mechanisms<b>.</b> <b>Results.</b> Five anti-OXA-40 and anti-OXA-58 mAbs were selected. Competition ELISA with combinations of these antibodies revealed that the anti-OXA-40 antibodies bind to one of two binding clusters on OXA-40, while anti-OXA-58 antibodies bind to one of four binding clusters on OXA-58. Direct binding to the corresponding antigen in an ICT format has left only three antibodies against rOXA-40<sub>His6</sub> and rOXA-58<sub>His6</sub>, respectively for the subsequent sandwich ICT selection procedure, which revealed that the anti-OXA-40 (#5) and anti-OXA-58 (#A8) mAbs in combination with the cross-reactive mAb #C8 performed best. They were implemented into single-OXA-40 and single-OXA-58 ICT prototypes and evaluated. These single ICT prototypes demonstrated 100 % specificity and sensitivity. Based on these results, an OXA-23/40/58/NDM-ICT was developed, complemented with OXA-23 and NDM-specific detection. An evaluation with selected carbapenem-resistant <i>Acinetobacter</i> spp. isolates (<i>n</i>=34) showed 100 % specificity<b>.</b> <b>Conclusion.</b> With this easy-to-use detection assay, one can save 12-48 h in diagnostics, which helps to treat patients earlier with appropriate antibiotics and allows immediate intervention to control transmission of CRAb<b>.</b>	2023 Apr	Sonja Mertins, Paul G Higgins, Caroline Thunissen, Henri Magein, Quentin Gilleman, Pascal Mertens, María González Rodríguez, Liza Marie Maus, Harald Seifert, Martin Krönke, Alexander Klimka	J Med Microbiol

35745838	Effectiveness and Nephrotoxicity of Loading Dose Colistin-Meropenem versus Loading Dose Colistin-Imipenem in the Treatment of Carbapenem-Resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> Infection.	Carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB) is becoming more widely recognized as a serious cause of nosocomial infections, and colistin has been reintroduced in recent years for the treatment of CRAB infection. Combinations of colistin and meropenem or imipenem have been found to be effective against CRAB isolates, whereas clinical investigations have not definitively demonstrated the theoretical benefits of colistin combined therapy in patients with CRAB infections. The objective of this study was to compare the primary outcome (30-day survival rate) and secondary outcomes (clinical response, microbiological response and nephrotoxicity) between patients who received loading dose (LD) colistin−meropenem and LD colistin−imipenem for the treatment of CRAB infection. A retrospective cohort analysis was performed at Chiang Mai University Hospital in patients with CRAB infection who received LD colistin−meropenem or LD colistin−imipenem between 2011 and 2017, and 379 patients fulfilled the requirements for the inclusion criteria. The results of this study showed that patients who received LD colistin−imipenem had a lower 30-day survival rate (adjusted HR = 0.57, 95% CI: 0.37−0.90; p = 0.015) and a lower clinical response (aHR = 0.56, 95% CI: 0.35−0.90; p = 0.017) compared with those who received LD colistin−meropenem. The microbiological response in patients with LD colistin−imipenem was 0.52 times (aHR) lower than that in those who received colistin−meropenem (95% CI: 0.34−0.81; p = 0.004); however, there was no significant difference in nephrotoxicity (aHR = 1.03, 95% CI: 0.67−1.57; p = 0.897) between the two combination regimens. In conclusion, when comparing the combination of LD colistin with imipenem or meropenem, the combination of LD colistin and meropenem provides a better survival rate for treating CRAB. Thus, we suggest that combinations of LD colistin and meropenem should be considered when treating CRAB infections.	2022 Jun	Wasan Katip, Peninnah Oberdorfer, Nongyao Kasatpibal	Pharmaceutics
35704614	Coexistence of blaNDM-1, blaOXA-51, blaOXA-23, and armA in conjunction with novel mutations detected in RND efflux pump regulators in tigecycline resistant clinical isolates of Acinetobacter baumannii.	This study has investigated a total of 51 Acinetobacter baumannii isolates for the prevalence of resistant determinants in tigecycline susceptible and non-susceptible clinical isolates of A. baumannii. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing revealed 74% of isolates were tigecycline resistant. Mutations in RND-efflux pump regulatory genes and the expression of efflux pump genes were measured in tigecycline resistant isolates. There was a strong co-relation between the blaNDM-1 and armA wherein majority of the isolates that are positive for blaNDM-1 have also harbored armA. Compared with TSAB (tigecycline susceptible A. baumannii), TNAB (tigecycline non-susceptible A. baumannii) isolates show increased distribution of blaNDM-1 (P = 0.048), blaIMP-1 (P< 0.0001) and blaOXA-51 (P = 0.0029) carbapenemase genes. The variants of RND-efflux pump regulatory genes due to amino-acid mutations in adeS (F12S, K84E, W61R, N268H and Q299R) and adeL (G21R and Q262R) were identified in tigecycline resistant isolates as well as ISAba1 mediated disruption of adeN were observed causing overexpression of adeIJK efflux pump. Additionally, mutations in adeRS were also associated with increased expression of adeABC efflux pump. Besides, TNAB isolates showed significantly (P< 0.0001) higher ability of biofilm formation as compared to TSAB isolates. The tigecycline resistance due to mutations in contemporary A. baumannii isolates having a higher ability to form biofilm may pose therapeutic difficulties.	2022 Jul	Ajit Ramesh Sawant, Sudhakar Pagal, Ashutosh Kumar Amar, Lipsa Panda, Sheela Devi C, P Shashikala, Reba Kanungo, K Prashanth	Pathog Dis

In this study, two NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>-N and S<sup>2-</sup> removal strains, namely, Kosakonia oryzae (FB2-3) and Acinetobacter baumannii (L5-4), were isolated from the packing materials in a long-running biotrickling filter (BTF). The removal capacities of combined FB2-3 and L5-4 (FB2-3 + L5-4) toward 100 mg L<sup>-1</sup> of NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>-N and 200 mg L<sup>-1</sup> of S<sup>2-</sup> reached 97.31 ± 1.62% and 98.57 ± 1.12% under the optimal conditions (32.0 °C and initial pH = 7.0), which were higher than those of single strain. Then, FB2-3 and L5-4 liquid inoculums were prepared, and their concentrations respectively reached 1.56 × 10<sup>9</sup> CFU mL<sup>-1</sup> and 1.05 × 10<sup>9</sup> CFU mL<sup>-1</sup> by adding different resuspension solutions and protective agents after 12-week storage at 25 °C. Finally, pilot-scale BTF test showed that NH<sub>3</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>S in the real exhaust gases from a pharmaceutical factory were effectively removed with removal rates > 87% and maximum elimination capacities were reached 136 g (NH<sub>3</sub>) m<sup>-3</sup> h<sup>-1</sup> and 176 g (H<sub>2</sub>S) m<sup>-3</sup> h<sup>-1</sup> at 18 °C-34 °C and pH 4.0-7.0 in the BTF loaded with bamboo charcoal packing materials co-immobilized with FB2-3 and L5-4.

36288018	Molecular Epidemiology of Clinical Carbapenem-Resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii-calcoaceticus</i> complex Isolates in Tertiary Care Hospitals in Java and Sulawesi Islands, Indonesia.	Carbapenem-resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii (A. baumannii)-calcoaceticus</i> complex (CRAb-cc) is an important pathogen causing nosocomial infections worldwide; however, molecular epidemiology of the <i>A. baumannii-calcoaceticus</i> complex in Indonesian hospitals is scarce. This study aimed to determine the clonal relatedness of CRAb-cc in two tertiary care hospitals in Malang and Manado in Indonesia. The CRAb-cc isolates from routine clinical cultures in two tertiary care hospitals in Malang and Manado were identified using the Vitek2<sup>®</sup> system (bioMérieux, Lyon, France). Multi-locus variable-number tandem-repeat analysis (MLVA) typing, multi-locus sequence typing (MLST), clonal complex (CC), and phylogenetic tree analysis were conducted for a subset of isolates. Seventy-three CRAb-cc isolates were collected. The CRAb-cc isolates were frequently found among lower-respiratory-tract specimens. We detected the MLVA type (MT) 1, MT3, and MT4 CRAB-cc isolates belonging to the sequence type (ST) 642, and CC1 was the predominant clone in this study. In conclusion, we identified the clonal relatedness of <i>A. baumannii-calcoaceticus</i> complex isolates in two tertiary care hospitals in Malang and Manado in Indonesia. Further study is required to investigate the clinical importance and distribution of ST642 in Indonesian hospitals for developing prevention and control measures.	2022 Sep	Heriyannis Homenta, Julyadharma Julyadharma, Hani Susianti, Noorhamdani Noorhamdani, Dewi Santosaningsih	Trop Med Infect Dis
36190276	Antimicrobial and Anti-Inflammatory Activities of MAF-1-Derived Antimicrobial Peptide Mt6 and Its D-Enantiomer D-Mt6 against Acinetobacter baumannii by Targeting Cell Membranes and Lipopolysaccharide Interaction.	Antibiotic resistance in Acinetobacter baumannii is on the rise around the world, highlighting the urgent need for novel antimicrobial drugs. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) contribute to effective protection against infections by pathogens, making them the most promising options for next-generation antibiotics. Here, we report two designed, cationic, antimicrobial-derived peptides: Mt6, and its dextroisomer D-Mt6, belonging to the analogs of MAF-1, which is isolated from the instar larvae of houseflies. Both Mt6 and D-Mt6 have a broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity that is accompanied by strong antibacterial activities, especially against <i>A. baumannii</i> planktonic bacteria and biofilms. Additionally, the effect of D-Mt6 against <i>A. baumannii</i> is stable in a variety of physiological settings, including enzyme, salt ion, and hydrogen ion environments. Importantly, D-Mt6 cleans the bacteria on Caenorhabditis elegans without causing apparent toxicity and exhibits good activity <i>in vivo</i>. Both Mt6 and D-Mt6 demonstrated synergistic or additive capabilities with traditional antibiotics against <i>A. baumannii</i>, demonstrating their characteristics as potential complements to combination therapy. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and laser scanning confocal microscope (LSCM) experiments revealed that two analogs displayed rapid bactericidal activity by destroying cell membrane integrity. Furthermore, in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated macrophage cells, these AMPs drastically decreased IL-1β and TNF-a gene expression and protein secretion, implying anti-inflammatory characteristics. This trait is likely due to its dual function of directly binding LPS and inhibiting the LPS-activated mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways in macrophages. Our findings suggested that D-Mt6 could be further developed as a novel antimicrobial/anti-inflammatory agent and used in the treatment of A. baumannii infections. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Around 700,000 people worldwide die each year from antibiotic-resistant pathogens. Acinetobacter baumannii in clinical specimens increases year by year, and it is developing a strong resistance to clinical drugs, which is resulting in <i>A. baumannii</i> becoming the main opportunistic pathogen. Antimicrobial peptides show great potential as new antibacterial drugs that can replace traditional antibiotics. In our study, Mt6 and D-Mt6, two new antimicrobial peptides, were designed based on a natural peptide that we first discovered in the hemlymphocytes of housefly larvae. Both Mt6 and D-Mt6 showed broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity, especially against <i>A. baumannii</i>, by damaging membrane integrity. Moreover, D-Mt6 showed better immunoregulatory activity against LPS induced inflammation through its LPS-neutralizing and suppression on MAPK signaling. This study suggested that D-Mt6 is a promising candidate drug as a derived peptide against A. baumannii.	2022 Oct	Delong Kong, Xuan Hua, Rui Zhou, Jie Cui, Tao Wang, Fanyun Kong, Hongjuan You, Xiangye Liu, Joseph Adu-Amankwaah, Guo Guo, Kuiyang Zheng, Jianwei Wu, Renxian Tang	Microbiol Spectr

36080431	Whole-Genome Analysis of <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> Strain AB43 Containing a Type I-Fb CRISPR-Cas System: Insights into the Relationship with Drug Resistance.	The CRISPR-Cas system is a bacterial and archaea adaptive immune system and is a newly recognized mechanism for controlling antibiotic resistance gene transfer. <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> (<i>A. baumannii</i>) is an important organism responsible for a variety of nosocomial infections. <i>A. baumannii</i> infections have become problematic worldwide because of the resistance of <i>A. baumannii</i> to multiple antibiotics. Thus, it is clinically significant to explore the relationship between the CRISPR-Cas system and drug resistance in <i>A. baumannii</i>. This study aimed to analyze the genomic characteristics of the <i>A. baumannii</i> strain AB3 containing the type I-Fb CRISPR-Cas system, which was isolated from a tertiary care hospital in China, and to investigate the relationship between the CRISPR-Cas system and antibiotic resistance in this strain. The whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of the AB43 strain was performed using Illumina and PacBio sequencing. The complete genome of AB43 consisted of a 3,854,806 bp chromosome and a 104,309 bp plasmid. The specific characteristics of the CRISPR-Cas system in AB43 are described as follows: (1) The strain AB43 carries a complete type I-Fb CRISPR-Cas system; (2) Homology analysis confirmed that the <i>cas</i> genes in AB43 share high sequence similarity with the same subtype <i>cas</i> genes; (3) A total of 28 of 105 <i>A. baumannii</i> AB43 CRISPR spacers matched genes in the bacteriophage genome database and the plasmid database, implying that the CRISPR-Cas system in AB43 provides immunity against invasive bacteriophage and plasmids; (4) None of the CRISPR spacers in <i>A. baumannii</i> AB43 were matched with antimicrobial resistance genes in the NCBI database. In addition, we analyzed the presence of antibiotic resistance genes and insertion sequences in the AB43 strain and found that the number of antibiotic resistance genes was not lower than in the "no CRISPR-Cas system" strain. This study supports the idea that the CRISPR-Cas system may inhibit drug-resistance gene expression via endogenous gene regulation, except to the published mechanism that the CRISPR-Cas system efficiently limits the acquisition of antibiotic resistance genes that make bacteria sensitive to antibiotics.	2022 Sep	Tingting Guo, Jie Yang, Xiaoli Sun, Yuhang Wang, Liying Yang, Guimei Kong, Hongmei Jiao, Guangyu Bao, Guocai Li	Molecules
35730377	Epidemiological and genetic characteristics of clinical carbapenem-resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> strains collected countrywide from hospital intensive care units (ICUs) in China.	<i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> is one of the key Gram-negative pathogens that can cause serious nosocomial infections. In China, a large proportion of clinical <i>A. baumannii</i> strains are multidrug resistant, among which strains resistant to carbapenems are particularly worrisome, as infections caused by such strains may limit the choice of existing antibiotics. We conducted a nationwide and genome-based surveillance on the prevalence and antibiotic susceptibility profile of carbapenem-resistant <i>A. baumannii</i> (CRAB) strains collected from intensive care units (ICUs) in hospitals in different provinces and investigated the routes of transmission and mechanism of resistance by whole-genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. We found that CRAB strains were prevalent in 71.4% (55/77) of the ICUs surveyed. Clonal spread of CRAB was found in 37.6% (29/77) of ICUs and a total of 22 different clones were identified. Most clones were transmissible within one ICU, but up to six clones could be detected in at least three hospitals. In addition, carbapenem-hydrolysing class D β-lactamases (CHDL) were found to be mainly responsible for carbapenem-resistance in <i>A. baumannii</i> and the ST2 global-clone is the predominant type of CRAB in China. Importantly, we found that CRAB isolates currently exhibited an extremely low rate of resistance to colistin (0.4%) and tigecycline (2.5%), but a high rate of resistance to ceftazidime-avibactam (70.2%). Findings in this work shall facilitate development of appropriate antimicrobial regimens for treatment of CRAB infections. Further surveillance and research on the evolutionary and epidemiological features of clinical CRAB strains are necessary.	2022 Dec	Congcong Liu, Kaichao Chen, Yuchen Wu, Ling Huang, Yinfei Fang, Jiayue Lu, Yu Zeng, Miaomiao Xie, Edward Wai Chi Chan, Sheng Chen, Rong Zhang	Emerg Microbes Infect
35735748	Differential Binding of Carbapenems with the AdeABC Efflux Pump and Modulation of the Expression of AdeB Linked to Novel Mutations within Two-Component System AdeRS in Carbapenem-Resistant Acinetobacter baumannii.	Resistance-nodulation-division-type efflux system AdeABC plays an important role in carbapenem resistance among Acinetobacter baumannii. However, a knowledge gap is observed regarding the role of its regulator AdeRS in carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii (CRAB). This study effectively combines microbiological analysis with an <i>in-silico</i> structural approach to understand the contribution of AdeRS among CRAB (<i>n</i> = 38). Additionally, molecular docking was performed for the first time to study the interaction of FDA-approved carbapenems and pump inhibitor PAβN with the open and closed structure of AdeB at the three binding sites (periplasmic, proximal, distal). It was observed that open conformation of AdeB facilitates the binding of carbapenems and PAβN at entrance and proximal sites compared to the closed conformation. PAβN was found to block carbapenem interacting residues in AdeB, establishing its role as a competitive inhibitor of AdeB substrates. Overexpression of AdeABC was detected by q-RT-PCR among 29% of CRABs, and several mutations within AdeS (GLY186VAL, SER188PHE, GLU121LYS, VAL255ILE) and AdeR (VAL120ILE, ALA136VAL) were detected by sequencing. The sequence and structure-based study of AdeRS was performed to analyze the probable effect of these mutations on regulation of the two-component system (TCS), especially, utilizing its three-dimensional structure. AdeS mutations inhibited the transfer of a phosphate group to AdeR, preventing the binding of AdeR to the intercistronic region, leading to overexpression of AdeABC. The elucidation of the role of mutations in AdeRS improves our understanding of TCS-based regulation. Identification of the key residues of AdeB interacting with carbapenems and PAβN may help in future designing of novel inhibitors. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> AdeABC is an important efflux pump in A. baumannii that plays a role in resistance toward different antibiotics including the "last resort" antibiotic, carbapenem. This pump is regulated by a two-component system, AdeRS. To understand the binding of carbapenems with AdeABC and pump inhibition by PAβN, we analyzed for the first time the possible atomic level interactions of carbapenems and PAβN with AdeB. In the current study, AdeRS-associated novel mutations in clinical A. baumannii are reported for the first time, and a sequence-structure based <i>in-silico</i> approach was used to interpret their role in AdeABC overexpression, leading to carbapenem resistance. None of the previous studies had undertaken both these aspects simultaneously. This study analyzes the open and closed conformation of AdeB, their binding with carbapenems, and key residues involved in it. This helps in visualizing the plausible atomic level causes of pump inhibition driving the discovery of novel inhibitors.	2022 Aug	Subhasree Roy, Vivek Junghare, Shanta Dutta, Saugata Hazra, Sulagna Basu	mSystems
37102650	Acinetobacter baumannii outer membrane protein A induces autophagy in bone marrow-derived dendritic cells involving the PI3K/mTOR pathway.	Outer membrane protein A (OmpA) is the major virulence factor of Acinetobacter baumannii and plays a wide role in the pathogenesis and antimicrobial resistance of A. baumannii. Dendritic cells (DCs) are the most effective antigen-presenting cells and play a crucial role in regulating the immune response to multiple antigens and immune sentries. We aimed to study the role and molecular mechanisms of OmpA-induced mouse bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) autophagy in the immune response of A. baumannii.	2023 Apr	Hongyi Tan, Liyan Cao	Immun Inflamm Dis

35740181	Identifying Targets for Antibiotic Use for the Management of Carbapenem-Resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> (CRAb) in Hospitals-A Multi-Centre Nonlinear Time-Series Study.	Solutions are needed to inform antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) regarding balancing the access to effective antimicrobials with the need to control antimicrobial resistance. Theoretical and mathematical models suggest a non-linear relationship between antibiotic use and resistance, indicating the existence of thresholds of antibiotic use beyond which resistance would be triggered. It is anticipated that thresholds may vary across populations depending on host, environment, and organism factors. Further research is needed to evaluate thresholds in antibiotic use for a specific pathogen across different settings. The objective of this study is to identify thresholds of population antibiotic use associated with the incidence of carbapenem-resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> (CRAb) across six hospital sites in Oman. The study was an ecological, multi-centre evaluation that involved collecting historical antibiotic use and CRAb incidence over the period from January 2015 to December 2019. By using non-linear time-series analysis, we identified different thresholds in the use of third-generation cephalosporins, piperacillin-tazobactam, aminoglycoside, and fluoroquinolones across participating hospitals. The identification of different thresholds emphasises the need for tailored analysis based on modelling data from each hospital. The determined thresholds can be used to set targets for each hospital AMS, providing a balance between access to these antibiotics versus controlling CRAb incidence.	2022 Jun	Zainab Said Al-Hashimy, Barbara R Conway, Mubarak Al-Yaqoobi, Faryal Khamis, Ghalib Zahran Al Mawali, Aisha Mahad Al Maashani, Yaqoob Said Al Hadhrami, Said Salim Al Alawi, Mohammed Said Al Mamari, William J Lattyak, Elizabeth A Lattyak, Motasem Aldiab, Ian Gould, José-María López-Lozano, Mamoon A Aldeyab	Antibiotics (Basel)

35843396	The K89 capsular polysaccharide produced by Acinetobacter baumannii LUH5552 consists of a pentameric repeat-unit that includes a 3-acetamido-3,6-dideoxy-d-galactose residue.	Acinetobacter baumannii isolate LUH5552 carries the KL89 capsule biosynthesis gene cluster. Capsular polysaccharide (CPS) isolated from LUH5552 was analyzed by sugar analysis, Smith degradation, and one- and two-dimensional <sup>1</sup>H and <sup>13</sup>C NMR spectroscopy. The K89 CPS structure has not been seen before in A. baumannii CPS structures resolved to date and includes a 3-acetamido-3,6-dideoxy-d-galactose (d-Fucp3NAc) residue which is rare amongst A. baumannii CPS. The K89 CPS has a →3)-α-d-GalpNAc-(1→3)-β-d-GlcpNAc-(1→ main chain with a β-d-Glcp-(1→2)-β-d-Fucp3NAc-(1→6)-d-Glcp side branch that is α-(1→4) linked to d-GalpNAc. The roles of the Wzy polymerase and the four glycosyltransferases encoded by the KL89 gene cluster in the biosynthesis of the K89 CPS were assigned. Two glycosyltransferases, Gtr121 and Gtr122, link the d-Fucp3NAc to its neighboring sugars.	2022 Sep	Nikolay P Arbatsky, Alexander S Shashkov, Mikhail M Shneider, Anastasiya V Popova, Anastasiya A Kasimova, Konstantin A Miroshnikov, Yuriy A Knirel, Ruth M Hall, Johanna J Kenyon	Int J Biol Macromol
36839558	Efficacy of Fosfomycin-Containing Regimens for Treatment of Bacteremia Due to Pan-Drug Resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> in Critically Ill Patients: A Case Series Study.	<i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> (AB) has evolved over the last decades as a major problem in carbapenem-resistant gram-negative nosocomial infections, associated with high mortality rates especially in the intensive care unit (ICU). Recent reports highlight the increasing prevalence of resistance to colistin, a last resort therapeutic option for carbapenem-resistant AB. We retrospectively evaluated the characteristics, treatment regimens and outcomes of twenty patients with pan-drug resistant (PDR) AB primary bacteremia hospitalized in the ICU of the University General Hospital of Patras, during a two-year period (October 2020-September 2022). The 28-day mortality reached 50%. Between survivors and non-survivors, no differences were found regarding age, gender, and Charlson comorbidity index (CCI). However, non-survivors had higher APACHE II scores and higher prevalence of septic shock and COVID-19 infection. A significantly higher percentage in the survivor group received Fosfomycin as part of the combination regimen. Inclusion of fosfomycin in the combination therapeutic regimen was associated with significantly better survival as compared to non-fosfomycin-containing regimens. In view of the increasing prevalence of PDR-AB infections in ICUs, its associated high rates of mortality and the lack of effective treatment options, the observed survival benefit with fosfomycin inclusion in the therapeutic regimen merits further validation in larger prospective studies.	2023 Feb	Stelios F Assimakopoulos, Vassilis Karamouzos, Gerasimos Eleftheriotis, Maria Lagadinou, Christina Bartzavali, Fevronia Kolonitsiou, Fotini Paliogianni, Fotini Fligou, Markos Marangos	Pathogens
34864936	Infectious Diseases Society of America Guidance on the Treatment of AmpC β-Lactamase-Producing Enterobacterales, Carbapenem-Resistant Acinetobacter baumannii, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia Infections.	The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) is committed to providing up-to-date guidance on the treatment of antimicrobial-resistant infections. A previous guidance document focused on infections caused by extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-E), carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa with difficult-to-treat resistance (DTR-P. aeruginosa). Here, guidance is provided for treating AmpC β-lactamase-producing Enterobacterales (AmpC-E), carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB), and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia infections. A panel of 6 infectious diseases specialists with expertise in managing antimicrobial-resistant infections formulated questions about the treatment of AmpC-E, CRAB, and S. maltophilia infections. Answers are presented as suggested approaches and corresponding rationales. In contrast to guidance in the previous document, published data on the optimal treatment of AmpC-E, CRAB, and S. maltophilia infections are limited. As such, guidance in this document is provided as "suggested approaches" based on clinical experience, expert opinion, and a review of the available literature. Because of differences in the epidemiology of resistance and availability of specific anti-infectives internationally, this document focuses on the treatment of infections in the United States. Preferred and alternative treatment suggestions are provided, assuming the causative organism has been identified and antibiotic susceptibility results are known. Approaches to empiric treatment, duration of therapy, and other management considerations are also discussed briefly. Suggestions apply for both adult and pediatric populations. The field of antimicrobial resistance is highly dynamic. Consultation with an infectious diseases specialist is recommended for the treatment of antimicrobial-resistant infections. This document is current as of 17 September 2021 and will be updated annually. The most current version of this document, including date of publication, is available at www.idsociety.org/practice-guideline/amr-guidance-2.0/.	2022 Jul	Pranita D Tamma, Samuel L Aitken, Robert A Bonomo, Amy J Mathers, David van Duin, Cornelius J Clancy	Clin Infect Dis
37052117	Sulbactam-durlobactam: A novel β-lactam-β-lactamase inhibitor combination targeting carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii infections.	Carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB) is a difficult-to-treat nosocomial pathogen responsible for significant morbidity and mortality. Sulbactam-durlobactam (SUL-DUR), formerly ETX2514SUL, is a novel β-lactam-β-lactamase inhibitor designed specifically for the treatment of CRAB infections. The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) fast-track approval of SUL-DUR for the treatment of CRAB infections is currently pending after completion of the phase III ATTACK trial, which compared SUL-DUR to colistin, both in combination with imipenem-cilastatin (IMI) for patients with CRAB-associated hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia, ventilator-associated pneumonia, and bacteremia. The results of this trial demonstrated that SUL-DUR was non-inferior to colistin for CRAB while also possessing a much more favorable safety profile. SUL-DUR was well-tolerated with the most common side effects being headache, nausea, and injection-site phlebitis. With the current landscape of limited effective treatment options for CRAB infections, SUL-DUR represents a promising therapeutic option for the treatment of these severe infections. This review will discuss the pharmacology, spectrum of activity, pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics, in vitro and clinical studies, safety, dosing, administration, as well as the potential role in therapy for SUL-DUR.	2023 Apr	Amer El-Ghali, Ashlan J Kunz Coyne, Kaylee Caniff, Callan Bleick, Michael J Rybak	Pharmacotherapy

37125469	The Pharmacokinetics/Pharmacodynamic Relationship of Durlobactam in Combination With Sulbactam in In Vitro and In Vivo Infection Model Systems Versus Acinetobacter baumannii-calcoaceticus Complex.	Sulbactam-durlobactam is a β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combination currently in development for the treatment of infections caused by Acinetobacter, including multidrug-resistant (MDR) isolates. Although sulbactam is a β-lactamase inhibitor of a subset of Ambler class A enzymes, it also demonstrates intrinsic antibacterial activity against a limited number of bacterial species, including Acinetobacter, and has been used effectively in the treatment of susceptible Acinetobacter-associated infections. Increasing prevalence of β-lactamase-mediated resistance, however, has eroded the effectiveness of sulbactam in the treatment of this pathogen. Durlobactam is a rationally designed β-lactamase inhibitor within the diazabicyclooctane (DBO) class. The compound demonstrates a broad spectrum of inhibition of serine β-lactamase activity with particularly potent activity against class D enzymes, an attribute which differentiates it from other DBO inhibitors. When combined with sulbactam, durlobactam effectively restores the susceptibility of resistant isolates through β-lactamase inhibition. The present review describes the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) relationship associated with the activity of sulbactam and durlobactam established in nonclinical infection models with MDR Acinetobacter baumannii isolates. This information aids in the determination of PK/PD targets for efficacy, which can be used to forecast efficacious dose regimens of the combination in humans.	2023 May	John P O'Donnell, Sujata M Bhavnani	Clin Infect Dis
36822004	A new acridine-based photosensitizer with ultra-low light requirement efficiently inactivates carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and degrades their antibiotic resistance genes.	The spread of antibiotic resistant pathogens and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in the environment poses a serious threat to public health. However, existing methods are difficult to effectively remove antibiotic resistant pathogens and ARGs from the environment. In this study, we synthesized a new acridine-based photosensitizer, 2,7-dibromo-9-mesityl-10-methylacridinium perchlorate (YM-3), by the heavy atom effect, which could photodynamically inactivate antibiotic resistant pathogens and reduce ARGs by generating singlet oxygen (<sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>) in an aqueous environment. The <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> yield of YM-3 was 4.9 times that of its modified precursor. YM-3 could reduce the culturable number and even the viable counts of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii to 0 (inactivation rate > 99.99999%) after 2 and 8 h of low-intensity blue light (15 W/m<sup>2</sup>) irradiation, respectively. After 20 h of light exposure, the copy numbers of ARGs in both bacteria were reduced by 5.80 and 4.48 log, respectively, which might indicate that ARGs had been degraded. In addition, YM-3 still had an efficient bactericidal effect after five inactivation cycle. These characteristics of ultra-low light intensity requirement and efficient bactericidal ability make YM-3 have good application prospects for disinfection in indoor and sunlight environment.	2023 Mar	Xiaojie Xu, Min Yang, Yunhan Jiang, Ningyao Tao, Yulong Fu, Jiahui Fan, Xin Xu, Huixiang Shi, Zhan Lu, Chaofeng Shen	Environ Int
36944292	Carboxymuconolactone decarboxylase is a prospective molecular target for multi-drug resistant Acinetobacter baumannii-computational modeling, molecular docking and dynamic simulation studies.	Multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (MDRAb), a priority-I pathogen declared by the World Health Organization, became a potential healthcare concern worldwide with a high mortality rate. Thus, the identification of putative molecular targets and potential lead molecules is an important concern in healthcare. The present study aimed to screen a prospective molecular target and effectual binders for the drug discovery of MDRAb by computational virtual screening approach. Based on the functional role, γ-carboxymuconolactone decarboxylase (CMD) was prioritized as the target and its three-dimensional (3D) structure was computationally modeled. Based on the availability of the 3D structure, twenty-five herbal molecules were selected by database search, and their drug-likeliness, pharmacokinetic, and toxicity features were predicted. The effectual binding of the selected molecules towards CMD was predicted by molecular docking. The stability of the best-docked complexes was predicted by molecular dynamics (MD) simulation for 100 ns and binding energy calculations were carried out by molecular mechanics generalized Born and surface area solvation (MM/GBSA) method. Out of twenty-five molecules screened, hirsutine (an indole alkaloid of Uncaria rhynchophylla) and thymoquinone (a phytochemical of Nigella sativa) were qualified for drug likeliness, pharmacokinetic, and toxicity features and demonstrated significant effectual binding to CMD when compared with the binding of co-crystallized inhibitor and CMD (control). The docked complexes of hirsutine and thymoquinone, and CMD were stabilized by the binding energies of -8. 30 and -8. 46 kcal/mol respectively. These molecules were qualified in terms of ideal drug likeliness, ADME, and toxicity properties. MD simulation studies showed that the ligand-protein complexes were stable throughout the simulation. The binding free energies of the complexes by MMGBSA were estimated to be -42.08157745 kcal/mol and -36.58618242 kcal/mol for hirsutine and thymoquinone respectively when compared with the calculated binding free energy of the control (-28.75032666 kcal/mol). This study concluded that hirsutine and thymoquinone can act as potential lead molecules against CMD and the present hypothesis can be scaled up to develop potential inhibitors against MDRAb.	2023 May	Shraddha Rana, Sinosh Skariyachan, Akshay Uttarkar, Vidya Niranjan	Comput Biol Med

36139948	The Molecular Detection of Class B and Class D Carbapenemases in Clinical Strains of <i>Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-baumannii</i> Complex: The High Burden of Antibiotic Resistance and the Co-Existence of Carbapenemase Genes.	The emergence of carbapenem-resistant <i>Acinetobacter calcoaceticus</i>-<i>baumannii</i> complex (CRACB) in clinical environments is a significant global concern. These critical pathogens have shown resistance to a broad spectrum of antibacterial drugs, including carbapenems, mostly due to the acquisition of various β-lactamase genes. Clinical samples (n = 1985) were collected aseptically from multiple sources and grown on blood and MacConkey agar. Isolates and antimicrobial susceptibility were confirmed with the VITEK-2 system. The modified Hodge test confirmed the CRACB phenotype, and specific PCR primers were used for the molecular identification of <i>bla</i><sub>OXA</sub> and <i>bla</i><sub>NDM</sub> genes. Of the 1985 samples, 1250 (62.9%) were culture-positive and 200 (43.9%) were CRACB isolates. Of these isolates, 35.4% were recovered from pus samples and 23.5% from tracheal secretions obtained from patients in intensive care units (49.3%) and medical wards (20.2%). An antibiogram indicated that 100% of the CRACB isolates were resistant to β-lactam antibiotics and β-lactam inhibitors, 86.5% to ciprofloxacin, and 83.5% to amikacin, while the most effective antibiotics were tigecycline and colistin. The CRACB isolates displayed resistance to eight different AWaRe classes of antibiotics. All isolates exhibited the <i>bla</i><sub>OXA-51</sub> gene, while <i>bla</i><sub>OXA-23</sub> was present in 94.5%, <i>bla</i><sub>VIM</sub> in 37%, and <i>bla</i><sub>NDM</sub> in 14% of the isolates. The <i>bla</i><sub>OXA-51</sub>, <i>bla</i><sub>OXA-23</sub>, and <i>bla</i><sub>OXA-24</sub> genes co-existed in 13 (6.5%) isolates. CRACB isolates with co-existing <i>bla</i><sub>OXA-23</sub>, <i>bla</i><sub>OXA-24</sub>, <i>bla</i><sub>NDM</sub>, <i>bla</i><sub>OXA-51</sub> and <i>bla</i><sub>VIM</sub> genes were highly prevalent in clinical samples from Pakistan. CRACB strains were highly critical pathogens and presented resistance to virtually all antibacterial drugs, except tigecycline and colistin.	2022 Aug	Hasan Ejaz, Muhammad Usman Qamar, Kashaf Junaid, Sonia Younas, Zeeshan Taj, Syed Nasir Abbas Bukhari, Abualgasim E Abdalla, Khalid O A Abosalif, Naveed Ahmad, Zikria Saleem, Eman H M Salem	Antibiotics (Basel)
35631436	Bacterial Community and Genomic Analysis of Carbapenem-Resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> Isolates from the Environment of a Health Care Facility in the Western Region of Saudi Arabia.	The escalating transmission of hospital-acquired infections, especially those due to antimicrobial-resistant bacteria, is a major health challenge worldwide. In this study, a culturomic analysis of bacterial community in a tertiary care hospital in the western region of Saudi Arabia is performed using environmental samples. The genome sequencing of four <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> was performed on isolates recovered from an intensive care unit (ICU) environment and clinical samples. A total of 361 bacterial isolates from surface and air samples were identified by MALDI-TOF technique or 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The isolates were classified into 70 distinct species, including ESKAPE pathogens. Resistance in Gram-positive isolates was mainly found to be against benzylpenicillin, azithromycin, ampicillin, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Carbapenem- and multidrug-resistant isolates of <i>A. baumannii</i> and <i>Klebsiella pneumonia</i> were found on the ICU surfaces. Genome sequencing revealed that the carbapenem-resistant <i>A. baumannii</i> isolate from ICU environment was linked with those of clinical origin.

37107006	Sulfonamidoboronic Acids as "Cross-Class" Inhibitors of an Expanded-Spectrum Class C Cephalosporinase, ADC-33, and a Class D Carbapenemase, OXA-24/40: Strategic Compound Design to Combat Resistance in <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>.	<i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> is a Gram-negative organism listed as an urgent threat pathogen by the World Health Organization (WHO). Carbapenem-resistant <i>A. baumannii</i> (CRAB), especially, present therapeutic challenges due to complex mechanisms of resistance to <i>β</i>-lactams. One of the most important mechanisms is the production of <i>β</i>-lactamase enzymes capable of hydrolyzing <i>β</i>-lactam antibiotics. Co-expression of multiple classes of <i>β</i>-lactamases is present in CRAB; therefore, the design and synthesis of "cross-class" inhibitors is an important strategy to preserve the efficacy of currently available antibiotics. To identify new, nonclassical <i>β</i>-lactamase inhibitors, we previously identified a sulfonamidomethaneboronic acid <b>CR167</b> active against <i>Acinetobacter</i>-derived class C <i>β</i>-lactamases (ADC-7). The compound demonstrated affinity for ADC-7 with a <i>K</i><sub>i</sub> = 160 nM and proved to be able to decrease MIC values of ceftazidime and cefotaxime in different bacterial strains. Herein, we describe the activity of <b>CR167</b> against other <i>β</i>-lactamases in <i>A. baumannii</i>: the cefepime-hydrolysing class C extended-spectrum <i>β</i>-lactamase (ESAC) ADC-33 and the carbapenem-hydrolyzing OXA-24/40 (class D). These investigations demonstrate <b>CR167</b> as a valuable cross-class (C and D) inhibitor, and the paper describes our attempts to further improve its activity. Five chiral analogues of <b>CR167</b> were rationally designed and synthesized. The structures of OXA-24/40 and ADC-33 in complex with <b>CR167</b> and select chiral analogues were obtained. The structure activity relationships (SARs) are highlighted, offering insights into the main determinants for cross-class C/D inhibitors and impetus for novel drug design.	2023 Mar	Maria Luisa Introvigne, Trevor J Beardsley, Micah C Fernando, David A Leonard, Bradley J Wallar, Susan D Rudin, Magdalena A Taracila, Philip N Rather, Jennifer M Colquhoun, Shaina Song, Francesco Fini, Kristine M Hujer, Andrea M Hujer, Fabio Prati, Rachel A Powers, Robert A Bonomo, Emilia Caselli	Antibiotics (Basel)

36846794	Dynamic state of plasmid genomic architectures resulting from XerC/D-mediated site-specific recombination in <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> Rep_3 superfamily resistance plasmids carrying <i>bla<sub>OXA-58</sub></i> - and Tn<i>aphA6</i>-resistance modules.	The acquisition of <i>bla</i> <sub>OXA</sub> genes encoding different carbapenem-hydrolyzing class-D β-lactamases (CHDL) represents a main determinant of carbapenem resistance in the nosocomial pathogen <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>. The <i>bla<sub>OXA-58</sub></i> gene, in particular, is generally embedded in similar resistance modules (RM) carried by plasmids unique to the <i>Acinetobacter</i> genus lacking self-transferability. The ample variations in the immediate genomic contexts in which <i>bla<sub>OXA-58</sub></i> -containing RMs are inserted among these plasmids, and the almost invariable presence at their borders of non-identical 28-bp sequences potentially recognized by the host XerC and XerD tyrosine recombinases (pXerC/D-like sites), suggested an involvement of these sites in the lateral mobilization of the gene structures they encircle. However, whether and how these pXerC/D sites participate in this process is only beginning to be understood. Here, we used a series of experimental approaches to analyze the contribution of pXerC/D-mediated site-specific recombination to the generation of structural diversity between resistance plasmids carrying pXerC/D-bounded <i>bla</i> <sub>OXA-58</sub>- and Tn<i>aphA6</i>-containing RM harbored by two phylogenetically- and epidemiologically-closely related <i>A. baumannii</i> strains of our collection, Ab242 and Ab825, during adaptation to the hospital environment. Our analysis disclosed the existence of different <i>bona fide</i> pairs of recombinationally-active pXerC/D sites in these plasmids, some mediating reversible intramolecular inversions and others reversible plasmid fusions/resolutions. All of the identified recombinationally-active pairs shared identical GGTGTA sequences at the cr spacer separating the XerC- and XerD-binding regions. The fusion of two Ab825 plasmids mediated by a pair of recombinationally-active pXerC/D sites displaying sequence differences at the cr spacer could be inferred on the basis of sequence comparison analysis, but no evidence of reversibility could be obtained in this case. The reversible plasmid genome rearrangements mediated by recombinationally-active pairs of pXerC/D sites reported here probably represents an ancient mechanism of generating structural diversity in the <i>Acinetobacter</i> plasmid pool. This recursive process could facilitate a rapid adaptation of an eventual bacterial host to changing environments, and has certainly contributed to the evolution of <i>Acinetobacter</i> plasmids and the capture and dissemination of <i>bla</i> <sub>OXA-58</sub> genes among <i>Acinetobacter</i> and non-<i>Acinetobacter</i> populations co-residing in the hospital niche.	2023	Lucía Giacone, M Marcela Cameranesi, Rocío I Sanchez, Adriana S Limansky, Jorgelina Morán-Barrio, Alejandro M Viale	Front Microbiol

36296249	Computer-Based Identification of Potential Druggable Targets in Multidrug-Resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>: A Combined In Silico, In Vitro and In Vivo Study.	The remarkable rise in antimicrobial resistance is alarming for <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>, which necessitates effective strategies for the discovery of promising anti-acinetobacter agents. We used a subtractive proteomics approach to identify unique protein drug targets. Shortlisted targets passed through subtractive channels, including essentiality, non-homology to the human proteome, druggability, sub-cellular localization prediction and conservation. Sixty-eight drug targets were shortlisted; among these, glutamine synthetase, dihydrodipicolinate reductase, UDP-N-acetylglucosamine acyltransferase, aspartate 1-decarboxylase and bifunctional UDP-N-acetylglucosamine diphosphorylase/glucosamine-1-phosphate N-acetyltransferase were evaluated in vitro by determining the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of candidate ligands, citric acid, dipicolinic acid, D-tartaric acid, malonic acid and 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid (MES), respectively, which ranged from 325 to 1500 μg/mL except for MES (25 mg/mL). The candidate ligands, citric acid, D-tartaric acid and malonic acid, showed good binding energy scores to their targets upon applying molecular docking, in addition to a significant reduction in <i>A. baumannii</i> microbial load in the wound infection mouse model. These ligands also exhibited good tolerability to human skin fibroblast. The significant increase in the MIC of malonic acid in β-alanine and pantothenate-supplemented media confirmed its selective inhibition to aspartate 1-decarboxylase. In conclusion, three out of sixty-eight potential <i>A. baumannii</i> drug targets were effectively inhibited in vitro and in vivo by promising ligands.	2022 Oct	Omar H Badie, Ahmed F Basyony, Reham Samir	Microorganisms
36608719	Geographic patterns of carbapenem-resistant, multi-drug-resistant and difficult-to-treat Acinetobacter baumannii in the Asia-Pacific region: results from the Antimicrobial Testing Leadership and Surveillance (ATLAS) program, 2020.	This study evaluated the in-vitro activity of multiple classes of antibiotics, including novel β-lactam combination agents, tigecycline and colistin, against carbapenem-resistant (CRAB), multi-drug-resistant (MDRAB) and difficult-to-treat (DTRAB) Acinetobacter baumannii. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined using the broth microdilution method. Susceptibility profiles and the distribution of selected antimicrobials among countries were illustrated and examined based on the breakpoints of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute, European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing and the US Food and Drug Administration. In total, 847 A. baumannii isolates were evaluated, and 692 isolates were characterized as CRAB, MDRAB or DTRAB. The prevalence of drug-resistant A. baumannii was >70.0% in South Korea, India and China, while the resistance rate of tigecycline was <5.5%. The MICs of meropenem and meropenem/vaborbactam for drug-resistant A. baumannii were equal (both MIC<sub>50</sub> and MIC<sub>90</sub> were 32 mg/L, range 0.25-32 mg/L). The overall resistance rate remained high for multiple classes of antibiotics, including penicillins, cephalosporins, carbapenems, quinolones and aminoglycosides (>84.0%, >96.0%, >98.0%, >88.0% and >87.0%, respectively), but not colistin or tigecycline (1.1% and 4.3%, respectively). China showed the lowest susceptibility to tigecycline for drug-resistant A. baumannii isolates compared with other countries. In conclusion, the resistance rate of drug-resistant A. baumannii remains high against multiple classes of antimicrobials. Colistin was the most potent agent, followed by tigecycline. The geographic pattern of tigecycline-resistant A. baumannii varied among countries. Therefore, continuous surveillance of A. baumannii resistance profiles in different regions is required.	2023 Feb	Chih-Hao Chen, Pin-Han Wu, Min-Chi Lu, Mao-Wang Ho, Po-Ren Hsueh	Int J Antimicrob Agents

36985347	Healthcare-Associated Bloodstream Infections Due to Multidrug-Resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> in COVID-19 Intensive Care Unit: A Single-Center Retrospective Study.	Healthcare-associated infections are an emerging cause of morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 intensive care units (ICUs) worldwide, especially those caused by multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens. The objectives of this study were to assess the incidence of bloodstream infections (BSIs) among critically ill COVID-19 patients and to analyze the characteristics of healthcare-associated BSIs due to MDR <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> in an COVID-19 ICU. A single-center retrospective study was conducted at a tertiary hospital during a 5-month period. The detection of carbapenemase genes was performed by PCR and genetic relatedness by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and multilocus-sequence typing. A total of 193 episodes were registered in 176 COVID-19 ICU patients, with an incidence of 25/1000 patient-days at risk. <i>A. baumannii</i> was the most common etiological agent (40.3%), with a resistance to carbapenems of 100%. The <i>bla</i><sub>OXA-23</sub> gene was detected in ST2 isolates while the <i>bla</i><sub>OXA-24</sub> was ST636-specific. PFGE revealed a homogeneous genetic background of the isolates. The clonal spread of OXA-23-positive <i>A. baumannii</i> is responsible for the high prevalence of MDR <i>A. baumannii</i> BSIs in our COVID-19 ICU. Further surveillance of resistance trends and mechanisms is needed along with changes in behavior to improve the implementation of infection control and the rational use of antibiotics.	2023 Mar	Karolina Dobrović, Tea Škrobo, Katarina Selec, Marko Jelić, Rok Čivljak, Jasminka Peršec, Sanja Sakan, Nikolina Bušić, Antonija Mihelčić, Sonja Hleb, Arjana Tambić Andrašević	Microorganisms

37148452	Antibacterial Properties and Efficacy of LL-37 Fragment GF-17D3 and Scolopendin A2 Peptides Against Resistant Clinical Strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumannii In Vitro and In Vivo Model Studies.	Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Acinetobacter baumannii have emerged as major clinical threats owing to the increasing prevalence of ventilator-associated pneumonia caused by multidrug-resistant or extensively drug-resistant strains. The present study aimed to assess the antibacterial effects and efficacy of LL-37 fragment GF-17D3 and synthetic Scolopendin A2 peptides against resistant clinical strains in vitro and in vivo models. P. aeruginosa, S. aureus, and A. baumannii were isolated from clinical infections. Their antibiotic resistance and minimum inhibitory concentration were assessed. LL-37 fragment GF-17D3 peptide was selected from available databases. Scolopendin A2 peptide's 6th amino acid (proline) was substituted with lysine and peptides and MICs were determined. The biofilm inhibitory activity was quantified at sub MIC concentrations. Synergetic effects of Scolopendin A2 and imipenem were assessed by checkerboard. After mice nasal infection with P. aeruginosa, peptides LD50 was determined. Isolates harbored complete resistance toward the majority of antibiotics and MIC values ranged between 1 and > 512 µg/ml. The majority of isolates exhibited strong biofilm activity. Synthetic peptides showed lower MIC values than antibiotic agents and the lowest MIC values were obtained for synthetic peptides in combination with antibiotics. The Synergisms effect of Scolopendin A2 with imipenem was also determined. Scolopendin A2 was found to have antibacterial efficacy against P. aeruginosa, S. aureus, and A. baumannii with MIC 64 µg/ml, 8 µg/ml, and 16 µg/ml, respectively, and LL37 showed antibacterial efficacy against P. aeruginosa, S. aureus, and A. baumannii with MIC 128 µg/ml, 32 µg/ml, and 32 µg/ml, respectively. Both AMPs decreased biofilms by ≥ 96% at 1 × MIC. The biofilm inhibitory activity was measured at sub MIC concentrations of the peptides and the results demonstrated that Scolopendin A2 exhibited anti-biofilm activity at 1/4 × MIC and 1/2 × MIC concentrations was 47.9 to 63.8%, although LL37 among 1/4 × MIC and 1/2 × MIC concentrations was 21.3 to 49.6% against three pathogens. The combination of Scolopendin A2 and antibiotics demonstrated synergistic activity-resistant strains with FIC values ≤ 0.5 for three pathogens, while LL37 and antibiotics showed synergistic activity FIC values ≤ 0.5 for only P. aeruginosa. Infection model Scolopendin A2 with Imipenem (2 × MIC) was efficacious in vivo, with a 100% survival rate following treatment at 2 × MIC after 120 h. The mRNA expression of biofilm-related genes was decreased for both peptides. Synthesis Scolopendin A2 decreased the expression of biofilm formation genes compared to the control group. Synthetic Scolopendin A2 exhibits antimicrobial activity without causing toxicity on the human epithelial cell line. Based on our findings, it seems that synthetic Scolopendin A2 is an appropriate antimicrobial source. That could be a promising option in combination with antibiotics for a topical medication and in the prevention of acute and chronic infections caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria. Nevertheless, additional experiments are required to assess another potential of this novel AMP.	2023 May	Nastaran Farzi, Mana Oloomi, Golnaz Bahramali, Seyed Davar Siadat, Saeid Bouzari	Probiotics Antimicrob Proteins

Although the combination of polymyxin and tigecycline is widely used in treating carbapenem-resistant bacterial infections, the benefit of this combination is still uncertain. To assess whether adding polymyxin B to the high-dose tigecycline regimen would result in better clinical outcomes than the high-dose tigecycline therapy in patients with pneumonia caused by carbapenem-resistant <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i> and <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>, we conducted a propensity score-matched cohort study in a single center between July 2019 and December 2021. Of the 162 eligible patients, 102 were included in the 1:1 matched cohort. The overall 14-day mortality in the matched cohort was 24.5%. Compared with high-dose tigecycline, the combination therapy was not associated with better clinical outcomes, and showed similar 14-day mortality (OR, 0.72, 95% CI 0.27-1.83, <i>p</i> = 0.486), clinical cure (OR, 1.09, 95% CI 0.48-2.54, <i>p</i> = 0.823), microbiological cure (OR, 0.96, 95% CI 0.39-2.53, <i>p</i> = 0.928) and rate of nephrotoxicity (OR 0.85, 95% CI 0.36-1.99, <i>p</i> = 0.712). Subgroup analyses also did not demonstrate any statistical differences. Based on these results, it is reasonable to recommend against adding polymyxin B to the high-dose tigecycline regimen in treating pneumonia caused by carbapenem-resistant <i>K. pneumoniae</i> and <i>A. baumannii</i>.	2023 Jan	Lei Zha, Xue Zhang, Yusheng Cheng, Qiancheng Xu, Lingxi Liu, Simin Chen, Zhiwei Lu, Jun Guo, Boris Tefsen	Antibiotics (Basel)

36009980	A Randomized Controlled Trial of Colistin Combined with Sulbactam: 9 g per Day versus 12 g per Day in the Treatment of Extensively Drug-Resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> Pneumonia: An Interim Analysis.	Extensively drug-resistant <i>A. baumannii</i> (XDRAB) pneumonia has a high mortality rate in hospitalized patients. One of the recommended treatments is colistin combined with sulbactam; however, the optimal dosage of sulbactam is unclear. In an open-label, superiority, randomized controlled trial, patients diagnosed with XDRAB pneumonia were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive colistin in combination with sulbactam at either 9 g/day or 12 g/day. The primary outcome was the 28-day mortality rate in the intention-to-treat population. A total of 88 patients received colistin in combination with sulbactam at a dosage of either 12 g/day (n = 45) or 9 g/day (n = 43). Trends toward a lower mortality rate were observed in the 12 g/day group at 7 days (11.1% vs. 23.3%), 14 days (33.3% vs. 41.9%), and 28 days (46.7% vs. 58.1%). The microbiological cure rate at day 7 was significantly higher in the 12 g/day group (90.5% vs. 58.1%; <i>p</i> = 0.02). Factors associated with mortality at 28 days were asthma, cirrhosis, APACHEII score ≥ 28, and a dosage of sulbactam of 9 g/day for mortality at any timepoint. Treatment with colistin combined with sulbactam at 12 g/day was not superior to the combination treatment with sulbactam at 9 g/day. However, due to being an interim analysis, this trial was underpowered to detect mortality differences.	2022 Aug	Chutchawan Ungthammakhun, Vasin Vasikasin, Dhitiwat Changpradub	Antibiotics (Basel)

37154773	Evaluation of Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization-Time of Flight Mass Spectrometry for Molecular Typing of Acinetobacter baumannii in Comparison with Orthogonal Methods.	Colonization and subsequent health care-associated infection (HCAI) with Acinetobacter baumannii are a concern for vulnerable patient groups within the hospital setting. Outbreaks involving multidrug-resistant strains are associated with increased patient morbidity and mortality and poorer overall outcomes. Reliable molecular typing methods can help to trace transmission routes and manage outbreaks. In addition to methods deployed by reference laboratories, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) may assist by making initial in-house judgments on strain relatedness. However, limited studies on method reproducibility exist for this application. We applied MALDI-TOF MS typing to A. baumannii isolates associated with a nosocomial outbreak and evaluated different methods for data analysis. In addition, we compared MALDI-TOF MS with whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) as orthogonal methods to further explore their resolution for bacterial strain typing. A related subgroup of isolates consistently clustered separately from the main outbreak group by all investigated methods. This finding, combined with epidemiological data from the outbreak, indicates that these methods identified a separate transmission event unrelated to the main outbreak. However, the MALDI-TOF MS upstream approach introduced measurement variability impacting method reproducibility and limiting its reliability as a standalone typing method. Availability of in-house typing methods with well-characterized sources of measurement uncertainty could assist with rapid and dependable confirmation (or denial) of suspected transmission events. This work highlights some of the steps to be improved before such tools can be fully integrated into routine diagnostic service workflows for strain typing. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Managing the transmission of antimicrobial resistance necessitates reliable methods for tracking outbreaks. We compared the performance of MALDI-TOF MS with orthogonal approaches for strain typing, including WGS and FTIR, for Acinetobacter baumannii isolates correlated with a health care-associated infection (HCAI) event. Combined with epidemiological data, all methods investigated identified a group of isolates that were temporally and spatially linked to the outbreak, yet potentially attributed to a separate transmission event. This may have implications for guiding infection control strategies during an outbreak. However, the technical reproducibility of MALDI-TOF MS needs to be improved for it to be employed as a standalone typing method, as different stages of the experimental workflow introduced bias influencing interpretation of biomarker peak data. Availability of in-house methods for strain typing of bacteria could improve infection control practices following increased reports of outbreaks of antimicrobial-resistant organisms during the COVID-19 pandemic, related to sessional usage of personal protective equipment (PPE).	2023 May	Eloise J Busby, Ronan M Doyle, Clara Leboreiro Babe, Kathryn A Harris, Damien Mack, Gema Méndez-Cervantes, Denise M O'Sullivan, Vicky Pang, Zahra Sadouki, Priya Solanki, Jim F Huggett, Timothy D McHugh, Emmanuel Q Wey	Microbiol Spectr

Cefiderocol appeared to be a good option for the treatment of Carbapenem-resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> (CR-Ab), but to date, the guidelines and evidence available are conflicting.	2023 Apr	Maria Mazzitelli, Dario Gregori, Lolita Sasset, Marco Trevenzoli, Vincenzo Scaglione, Sara Lo Menzo, Serena Marinello, Daniele Mengato, Francesca Venturini, Ivo Tiberio, Paolo Navalesi, Annamaria Cattelan	Microorganisms
36752319	Structural and functional characterization of 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase (DXS) from <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>: identification of promising lead molecules from virtual screening, molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations.	The advent of multi drug resistance and extensive-drug resistance among various pathogens has caused a rise in nosocomial infections, which in turn has led to rising hospital-acquired infection-related mortality rates. Amongst them, carbapenem-resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> is one of the most notorious bacterial species, categorized as a Priority 1: Critical pathogen by the WHO. Therefore, the discovery and development of novel antibiotics, as well as the identification of potential inhibitors, have become the need of the hour. In this study, we have employed computational methods to explore and identify molecules capable of inhibiting enzymes essential in the methylerythritol 4-phosphate (MEP) biosynthetic pathway. The high throughput virtual screening of small molecules (Enamine Advanced Collection (AC) library) against the highly conserved substrate-binding site of the DXS target protein provided us with a total of 1000 molecules. The top four potential candidate molecules, namely-Z3353989070, Z3353989049, Z2295848528, and Z1685501455, alongside fluoropyruvate (control), a known inhibitor of DXS, was chosen for a molecular dynamic simulation study. The molecular dynamic simulation trajectories suggested high structural and thermodynamical stability and strong binding affinity of all the DXS-ligand complexes. Moreover, the MM/PBSA-based binding free energy calculations also exhibited strong interactions of the selected ligand molecules with DXS. In conclusion, we have found that all four molecules displayed better results and stronger binding affinity than the control. In the end, based on all the above-mentioned criteria, we have proposed Z3353989049 to be the promising lead candidate against DXS from <i>A. baumannii</i>.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

36976013	Genomic Characterization of Carbapenem-Resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB) in Mechanically Ventilated COVID-19 Patients and Impact of Infection Control Measures on Reducing CRAB Circulation during the Second Wave of the SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic in Milan, Italy.	COVID-19 has significantly affected hospital infection prevention and control (IPC) practices, especially in intensive care units (ICUs). This frequently caused dissemination of multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs), including carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB). Here, we report the management of a CRAB outbreak in a large ICU COVID-19 hub Hospital in Italy, together with retrospective genotypic analysis by whole-genome sequencing (WGS). Bacterial strains obtained from severe COVID-19 mechanically ventilated patients diagnosed with CRAB infection or colonization between October 2020 and May 2021 were analyzed by WGS to assess antimicrobial resistance and virulence genes, along with mobile genetic elements. Phylogenetic analysis in combination with epidemiological data was used to identify putative transmission chains. CRAB infections and colonization were diagnosed in 14/40 (35%) and 26/40 (65%) cases, respectively, with isolation within 48 h from admission in 7 cases (17.5%). All CRAB strains belonged to Pasteur sequence type 2 (ST2) and 5 different Oxford STs and presented <i>bla</i><sub>OXA-23</sub> gene-carrying Tn<i>2006</i> transposons. Phylogenetic analysis revealed the existence of four transmission chains inside and among ICUs, circulating mainly between November and January 2021. A tailored IPC strategy was composed of a 5-point bundle, including ICU modules' temporary conversion to CRAB-ICUs and dynamic reopening, with limited impact on ICU admission rate. After its implementation, no CRAB transmission chains were detected. Our study underlies the potentiality of integrating classical epidemiological studies with genomic investigation to identify transmission routes during outbreaks, which could represent a valuable tool to ensure IPC strategies and prevent the spread of MDROs. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Infection prevention and control (IPC) practices are of paramount importance for preventing the spread of multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) in hospitals, especially in the intensive care unit (ICU). Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) is seen as a promising tool for IPC, but its employment is currently still limited. COVID-19 pandemics have posed dramatic challenges in IPC practices, causing worldwide several outbreaks of MDROs, including carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB). We present the management of a CRAB outbreak in a large ICU COVID-19 hub hospital in Italy using a tailored IPC strategy that allowed us to contain CRAB transmission while preventing ICU closure during a critical pandemic period. The analysis of clinical and epidemiological data coupled with retrospective genotypic analysis by WGS identified different putative transmission chains and confirmed the effectiveness of the IPC strategy implemented. This could be a promising approach for future IPC strategies.	2023 Mar	Davide Mangioni, Valeria Fox, Liliane Chatenoud, Matteo Bolis, Nicola Bottino, Lisa Cariani, Flaminia Gentiloni Silverj, Caterina Matinato, Gianpaola Monti, Antonio Muscatello, Antonio Teri, Leonardo Terranova, Alessandra Piatti, Andrea Gori, Giacomo Grasselli, Nino Stocchetti, Claudia Alteri, Alessandra Bandera	Microbiol Spectr
