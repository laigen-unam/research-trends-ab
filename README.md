# Unsupervised learning and natural language processing highlight research trends in a superbug 
## Motivation
Antibiotic-resistance Acinetobacter baumannii is a very important nosocomial pathogen worldwide. Thousands of studies have been conducted about this pathogen. However, there has not been any attempt to use all this information to highlight the research trends concerning this pathogen. Here we use unsupervised learning and natural language processing (NLP), two areas of Artificial Intelligence, to analyse the most extensive database of articles created (5500+ articles, from 851 different journals, published over 3 decades).
